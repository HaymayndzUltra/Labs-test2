I have loaded the `2-master-rule-ai-collaboration-guidelines` rule, which covers collaboration protocols for our interaction. I am ready to begin.

I understand you want to create a PRD (Product Requirements Document). To help you create a comprehensive and effective PRD, I'll need to understand more about your specific product or project.

Could you please provide:

1. **What product or feature** are you building? (e.g., mobile app, web application, API, etc.)
2. **What is the main problem** this product solves?
3. **Who is your target audience** or user base?
4. **What is the scope** of this PRD? (MVP, full product, specific feature, etc.)

Once I have this context, I can help you structure a professional PRD that includes all the essential sections like executive summary, problem statement, user stories, technical requirements, success metrics, and more.
