# Maintenance Workflow

## Prerequisites
- Access to monitoring and backup systems
- Current runbook and on-call rotation

## Overview
Operate, monitor, patch, back up, and audit the system; handle support and plan enhancements.

## Steps

### Step 1: Monitoring & Alerts
Action: Ensure dashboards and alerts configured
Acceptance:
- [ ] Alerts triggered on SLO breaches

### Step 2: Patching & Backups
Action: Apply patches; verify backups with restore test
Acceptance:
- [ ] Patches current; backups restorable

### Step 3: Audits & Documentation
Action: Conduct security audits; update docs
Acceptance:
- [ ] Audits passed; docs current

### Step 4: Support & Roadmap
Action: Track tickets; maintain enhancement plan
Acceptance:
- [ ] SLA met; roadmap updated

## Evidence
- Audit outputs and remediation logs
- Backup restore proof

## Failure Modes & Troubleshooting
- Alert noise â†’ tune thresholds; deduplicate rules
- Backup restore failure â†’ review retention and storage; test smaller scope

## Overall Acceptance
- [ ] Patches current; backups restorable; audits passed
- [ ] Docs and roadmap updated
- [ ] Related Phases: 06 (post-deploy), 10 (observability)
