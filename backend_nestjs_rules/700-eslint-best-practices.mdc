- Use a consistent coding style by extending popular configurations (e.g., Airbnb).
- Enable TypeScript support with `@typescript-eslint` for type-aware linting.
- Set up rules to enforce best practices, such as no unused variables and consistent return types.
- Integrate ESLint with your CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality on every commit.
- Use `eslint --fix` to automatically correct simple issues.
