- Use migrations for database schema changes to maintain consistency.
- Define entities with clear relationships and use lazy loading where appropriate.
- Implement repository patterns for data access to encapsulate database logic.
- Use transactions for complex operations that involve multiple database changes.
- Optimize queries with proper indexing and avoid N+1 query problems.
