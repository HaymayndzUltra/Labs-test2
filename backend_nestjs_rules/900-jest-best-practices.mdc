- Write unit tests for all service methods and controllers.
- Use mocks and spies to isolate tests and avoid dependencies on external services.
- Implement integration tests for critical paths in your application.
- Use coverage reports to identify untested parts of your codebase.
- Organize tests in a clear structure that mirrors your application's architecture.
