- Use a consistent configuration across the team to avoid formatting conflicts.
- Integrate Prettier with ESLint to ensure code is both linted and formatted.
- Set up Prettier to run on pre-commit hooks to enforce formatting before code is pushed.
- Use the `--check` option in CI to ensure all files are properly formatted.
- Regularly update Prettier to benefit from the latest features and fixes.
