Create one comprehensive AI rule that:
Manages the creation of all other AI developer team rules
Plans and coordinates the entire AI team workflow
Ensures alignment between all AI agents
Manages file structure and what each AI should work on
Connects everything together in a unified system
Details
Master AI Orchestrator Rule:
1. Primary Function
AI Team Creator: Automatically generates individual AI agent rules
Project Planner: Creates comprehensive project plans and task breakdowns
File Manager: Determines what files each AI agent should create/modify
Coordinator: Ensures all AI agents work together seamlessly
Quality Controller: Maintains standards across all AI agents
2. Core Responsibilities
Team Management:
Analyze client requirements and determine needed AI agents
Generate specific AI agent rules based on project needs
Assign roles and responsibilities to each AI agent
Create communication protocols between agents
Project Planning:
Break down client requirements into specific tasks
Determine file structure and architecture
Plan development workflow and dependencies
Set quality standards and compliance requirements
File Coordination:
Define what files each AI agent should create
Specify which files each AI agent should read/modify
Ensure no conflicts between AI agents working on same files
Maintain file organization and naming conventions
3. Automated Rule Generation Process
Step 1: Project Analysis
Read client requirements and project brief
Identify technology stack and compliance needs
Determine project complexity and scope
Step 2: AI Team Creation
Generate specific AI agent rules based on project needs
Create role-specific responsibilities and boundaries
Define technical expertise areas for each agent
Step 3: File Management Setup
Create file structure plan
Assign specific files to specific AI agents
Define file dependencies and relationships
Set up file sharing and collaboration protocols
Step 4: Workflow Coordination
Create task dependencies and sequencing
Set up communication channels between agents
Define quality checkpoints and reviews
Establish progress tracking and reporting
4. File Management System
File Assignment Logic:
Frontend AI: Handles all UI/UX files, components, styles
Backend AI: Manages API files, database schemas, server code
DevOps AI: Controls deployment files, CI/CD, infrastructure
QA AI: Manages test files, validation scripts, quality checks
Documentation AI: Handles README, docs, guides, comments
File Coordination:
Prevent multiple AI agents from modifying same files
Ensure proper file dependencies and imports
Maintain consistent coding standards across all files
Track file changes and versions
5. Integration and Alignment
Cross-Agent Communication:
Shared project status and progress updates
File change notifications between agents
Quality checkpoints and approval workflows
Conflict resolution and coordination
Quality Assurance:
Consistent coding standards across all AI agents
Proper file organization and naming
Complete project structure and dependencies
Compliance with industry standards
Expected Outcome
For You:
One master rule that handles everything
No need to manually create individual AI agent rules
Automatic project planning and coordination
Complete file management and organization
For AI System:
Self-managing AI team that creates itself
Coordinated file management and development
Aligned workflow across all AI agents
Consistent quality and standards
For Projects:
Complete, organized file structure
Properly coordinated development workflow
No conflicts or overlaps between AI agents
Professional, consistent project delivery
