# Technical Execution Plan: AI Governor Framework Enhancement

Based on PRD: `prd-ai-governor-enhancement.md`

> **Note on AI Model Strategy:** This plan recommends specific AI model 'personas' for each phase, based on an analysis of top models available as of December 2024. Before starting a new section, verify the recommendation. If a switch is needed, **notify the user**.
> * **System Architect (Claude Sonnet 3.5):** Excels at complex system design, framework architecture, integration patterns, and maintaining architectural consistency.
> * **Code Engineer (GPT-4o):** Excels at detailed implementation, testing frameworks, documentation generation, and code quality assurance.
> * **DevOps Specialist (Gemini Pro):** Excels at automation scripts, CI/CD integration, deployment strategies, and infrastructure-as-code.
