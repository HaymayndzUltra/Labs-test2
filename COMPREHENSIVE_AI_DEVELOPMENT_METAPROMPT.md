- **Hierarchical README.md loading** for architectural context
- **Scope-based rule filtering** (master/common/project rules)
- **Context optimization** to prevent redundant file reads

**Communication Format:**
```
[RULE DISCOVERY] Loaded {X} rules across {Y} domains: {CONCISE_LIST}
[COMPLIANCE SCOPE] Task scope: {SCOPE}. Applicable rules: {FILTERED_LIST}
```

**Backend Signatures:**
- Django: manage.py, settings.py, migrations/, models/
- FastAPI: main.py, requirements.txt, routers/, schemas/
- Express: app.js, package.json, routes/, middleware/

### Generated Role Templates
**Frontend Roles:**
- FE_Component_Developer: component creation, props, state, styling
- FE_Page_Developer: page creation, routing, data fetching, SEO
- FE_State_Manager: state design, store setup, actions, reducers

**Backend Roles:**
- BE_Model_Developer: model creation, migrations, relationships
- BE_API_Developer: endpoint creation, serializers, views, permissions
- BE_Database_Manager: migrations, data seeding, backups, optimization

**Cross-Cutting Roles:**
- DevOps_Engineer: Docker, CI/CD, deployment
- QA_Tester: unit, integration, e2e testing
- Security_Auditor: security scanning, vulnerability checks

## QUALITY STANDARDS & COMPLIANCE

### Code Quality Checklist
**Robustness & Reliability:**
- Error handling with try-catch blocks
- Input validation with guard clauses
- Resource management and cleanup

**Simplicity & Clarity:**
- Single responsibility principle (20-30 line functions)
- Explicit naming conventions
- Maximum 3-level nesting depth

### Security Implementation
**Mandatory Security Documentation:**
- Authentication/authorization changes
- Cryptography implementations
- Input validation enhancements
- Rate limiting and protection mechanisms

### Production Readiness Validation
**Pre-Implementation Checks:**
- Real database integration (no mocks)
- Input validation schemas (Zod, Joi)
- Configuration externalization
- Comprehensive error handling

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

### Standard Communication Formats
- `[PROPOSED PLAN]` - Multi-step task planning
- `[TASK COMPLETED]` - Task completion announcements
- `[RULE CONFLICT]` - Rule violation notifications
- `[CLARIFICATION QUESTION]` - Ambiguity resolution
- `[RULE IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTION]` - Process enhancement proposals
- `[CONTEXT REFRESH SUGGESTION]` - Context preservation options

### Complex Feature Safety Protocol

## AUTOMATION PATTERNS

### Tool Usage Protocol
**Environment-Agnostic Approach:**
1. **Discovery:** Introspect available tools for task automation
2. **Execution:** Use tools when available, fallback to manual methods
3. **Platform Integration:** Consult official documentation first
4. **Native Pattern Prioritization:** Use platform-specific best practices

### Context Window Preservation
**Preservation Triggers:**
- Major task completion
- Phase transitions
- Extended sessions (>1 hour)
- Context saturation detection
- Complex feature milestones

**Preservation Sequence:**
1. Announce intent
2. Create context snapshot
3. Execute compact (never clear)
4. Reload context
5. Restore feature context
6. Confirm readiness

## RULE GOVERNANCE SYSTEM

### Rule Creation Protocol
**Four Pillars of Effective Rules:**
1. **Structure & Discoverability:** Proper naming, location, metadata
2. **Personality & Intent:** Clear persona and core principle
3. **Precision & Clarity:** Imperative language with [STRICT]/[GUIDELINE] prefixes
4. **Exemplarity & Contrast:** DO/DON'T examples with explanations

**Rule Classification:**
- `master-rule`: Global framework governance
- `common-rule`: Shared technical patterns
- `project-rule`: Project-specific conventions

### Rule Discovery & Application
**Priority System:**
1. Absolute directives (alwaysApply: true)
2. Scope matching (SCOPE field)
3. Keyword matching (TRIGGERS field)
4. Concept matching (TAGS field)

**Dynamic Re-evaluation:**
- Domain changes
- Location changes
- Explicit pivots
- TodoWrite scope transitions
