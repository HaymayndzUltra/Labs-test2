  "proposal_text": "Introduction: I specialize in Shopify, Liquid and related delivery patterns, focused on fast, accurate execution.\n\nUnderstanding of Project: You want a focused, reliable solution aligned to your goals and constraints. We’ll measure success against PageSpeed and related outcomes.\n\nSolution Approach: Rapid discovery → scope confirmation → implementation in small, reviewable increments. First, I’ll confirm blockers and access: Do we have collaborator access and a staging theme?; Target PageSpeed/ CWV scores (mobile/desktop)?; Apps or integrations that must remain untouched?.\n\nValue Proposition: Optimized Shopify theme to 90+ mobile PageSpeed while keeping installed apps Relevant stack focus: Shopify, Liquid.\n\nCall to Action: To keep things efficient, I’ll structure everything into clear phases with goals, deliverables, and acceptance criteria. If you could share any specific requirements or reference materials upfront, I’ll integrate them right away—so we finalize scope faster without needing long back-and-forth calls"
