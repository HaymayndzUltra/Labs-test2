First, I’ll confirm blockers and access: What are the success criteria and timeline constraints?; Who approves deliverables and how will feedback be provided?; Any compliance or accessibility requirements?.\n\nValue Proposition: Delivered proposals that consistently pass structure and CTA validation\n\nCall to Action: To keep things efficient, I’ll structure everything into clear phases with goals, deliverables, and acceptance criteria. If you could share any specific requirements or reference materials upfront, I’ll integrate them right away—so we finalize scope faster without needing long back-and-forth calls I’ll keep commits small, share quick previews, and confirm acceptance criteria per deliverable so review is fast."
