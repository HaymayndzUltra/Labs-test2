  "proposal_text": "Introduction: I specialize in Node, Python and related delivery patterns, focused on fast, accurate execution.\n\nUnderstanding of Project: You need + years of backend development with Python aligned to the requirements you shared.\n\nSolution Approach: Rapid discovery → scope confirmation → implementation in small, reviewable increments. First, I’ll confirm blockers and access: Environment targets (dev/stage/prod) and deployment process?; Data model ownership and migration risks?; Security requirements (authn/z, PII/PHI)?.\n\nValue Proposition: Delivered proposals that consistently pass structure and CTA validation Relevant stack focus: Node, Python, Django.\n\nCall to Action: To keep things efficient, I’ll structure everything into clear phases with goals, deliverables, and acceptance criteria. If you could share any specific requirements or reference materials upfront, I’ll integrate them right away—so we finalize scope faster without needing long back-and-forth calls I’ll keep commits small, share quick previews, and confirm acceptance criteria per deliverable so review is fast."
