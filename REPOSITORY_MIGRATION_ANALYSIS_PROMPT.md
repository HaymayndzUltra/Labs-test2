# 游꿢 GOAL-LEVEL PROMPT: Repository Migration Analysis

## AI System Analysis Role
You are a **Senior System Architect** and **Repository Migration Specialist** tasked with analyzing an entire codebase to determine the optimal folder structure for repository migration. Your analysis will ensure that only essential, production-ready, and well-organized components are included in the migrated repository.

## 游꿢 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Analyze the entire system comprehensively and provide a definitive recommendation on which folders/files should be included in a repository migration, with clear justification for each decision.

## 游늶 MANDATORY ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: System Discovery & Inventory
**[STRICT] Execute these steps in order:**

1. **Complete Directory Structure Analysis**
   - Map the entire repository structure recursively
   - Identify all top-level directories and their purposes
   - Document file counts, sizes, and types per directory
   - Identify hidden files and configuration files

2. **Dependency & Relationship Mapping**
   - Trace import/export relationships between modules
   - Identify external dependencies and their sources
   - Map configuration file dependencies
   - Document build system dependencies (Makefile, package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)

3. **Code Quality Assessment**
   - Identify test coverage per directory
   - Assess code documentation completeness
   - Check for linting/formatting consistency
   - Identify deprecated or unused code

### Phase 2: Categorization & Classification
**[STRICT] Classify each directory using this taxonomy:**

#### 游릭 ESSENTIAL (Must Include)
- **Core Application Logic**: Main business logic, algorithms, and core functionality
- **Production Code**: All production-ready source code
- **Configuration Files**: Essential configs (package.json, requirements.txt, Dockerfile, etc.)
- **Documentation**: README, API docs, architecture docs, user guides
- **Tests**: All test suites (unit, integration, e2e)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, deployment scripts, quality gates
- **Security**: Security configurations, compliance files, audit logs

#### 游리 CONDITIONAL (Include with Conditions)
- **Development Tools**: Only if they enhance developer experience
- **Templates**: Only if they're actively used and maintained
- **Scripts**: Only if they're essential for build/deployment
- **Examples**: Only if they demonstrate core functionality

#### 游댮 EXCLUDE (Do Not Include)
- **Temporary Files**: Cache, logs, temporary outputs
- **Build Artifacts**: Compiled code, generated files, dist folders
- **Development Artifacts**: IDE configs, local dev files
- **Backup Files**: Old versions, backup copies
- **Test Data**: Large datasets, test fixtures
- **Generated Content**: Auto-generated code, documentation

### Phase 3: Industry-Specific Analysis
**[STRICT] Apply industry-specific criteria:**

#### For Healthcare Projects
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Include all compliance-related files
- **Security**: Include all security configurations and audit trails
- **Data Protection**: Include encryption and data handling modules

#### For Financial Projects
- **SOX Compliance**: Include financial reporting and audit files
- **PCI Compliance**: Include payment processing security files
- **Regulatory**: Include all regulatory compliance documentation

#### For E-commerce Projects
- **Payment Processing**: Include payment gateway integrations
- **Security**: Include fraud prevention and security modules
- **Performance**: Include caching and optimization modules

### Phase 4: Migration Readiness Assessment
**[STRICT] Evaluate each component for migration readiness:**

1. **Code Maturity**
   - Is the code production-ready?
   - Are there proper error handling and logging?
   - Is the code well-documented?

2. **Dependency Health**
   - Are all dependencies up-to-date?
   - Are there any security vulnerabilities?
   - Are dependencies properly locked?

3. **Test Coverage**
   - What percentage of code is tested?
   - Are tests comprehensive and reliable?
   - Do tests cover edge cases?

4. **Documentation Quality**
   - Is the code self-documenting?
   - Are there clear README files?
   - Is API documentation complete?

### Phase 5: Size & Performance Optimization
**[STRICT] Optimize for repository size and performance:**

1. **File Size Analysis**
   - Identify large files that could be optimized
   - Check for duplicate files or redundant content
   - Assess if large files can be moved to external storage

2. **Build Time Optimization**
   - Identify files that slow down CI/CD
   - Check for unnecessary build dependencies
   - Optimize Docker layers and build processes

3. **Clone Time Optimization**
   - Minimize repository size for faster cloning
   - Use .gitignore effectively
   - Consider Git LFS for large files
