- **Files Removed**: 1 duplicate file
- **YAML Syntax Fixed**: 148 files

### üîß Optimizations Applied

#### 1. Metadata Standardization
- **Removed unused tags**: 191 unused tags identified and removed
- **Removed unused triggers**: 302 unused triggers identified and removed
- **Standardized YAML format**: Fixed malformed YAML frontmatter across all files
- **Consistent structure**: Ensured all rules follow the same metadata format

#### 2. Content Optimization
- **Reduced verbosity**: Removed excessive whitespace and redundant phrases
- **Simplified language**: Streamlined common patterns and phrases
- **Improved clarity**: Made directives more concise while maintaining meaning

### üöÄ Performance Impact

#### Before Optimization
- 149 rules with inconsistent metadata
- 1 duplicate rule
- 191 unused tags, 302 unused triggers
- Malformed YAML in many files

#### After Optimization
- 148 rules with standardized metadata
- 0 duplicate rules
- Clean, minimal tag/trigger sets
- Valid YAML syntax across all files
