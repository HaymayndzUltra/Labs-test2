# Enhanced Context Discovery Protocol

## Overview

This enhanced context discovery system builds upon the existing BIOS-like protocol to provide intelligent, industry-aware rule activation and pattern recognition. It extends the current system with advanced capabilities for multi-project environments and industry-specific compliance requirements.

## Core Enhancements

### 1. Industry Intelligence Engine

The enhanced system includes an intelligent industry classification system that automatically detects project context and activates relevant industry-specific rules.

#### Industry Classification Algorithm
```yaml
Classification Criteria:
  - Project keywords and naming patterns
  - Technology stack indicators
  - Directory structure patterns
  - Configuration file signatures
  - Dependencies and package.json analysis

Industry Mappings:
  healthcare:
    - Keywords: ["patient", "medical", "health", "clinic", "hospital", "hipaa"]
    - Tech Stack: ["healthcare-apis", "epic", "cerner", "hl7"]
    - Patterns: ["patient-portal", "medical-records", "appointment-scheduling"]
  
  finance:
    - Keywords: ["payment", "transaction", "banking", "financial", "sox", "pci"]
    - Tech Stack: ["stripe", "paypal", "financial-apis", "trading"]
    - Patterns: ["payment-processing", "account-management", "fraud-detection"]
  
  ecommerce:
    - Keywords: ["shop", "store", "product", "cart", "checkout", "gdpr"]
    - Tech Stack: ["shopify", "woocommerce", "stripe", "payment-gateways"]
    - Patterns: ["product-catalog", "shopping-cart", "order-management"]
  
  enterprise:
    - Keywords: ["enterprise", "saas", "multi-tenant", "sso", "admin"]
    - Tech Stack: ["auth0", "okta", "salesforce", "microsoft-365"]
    - Patterns: ["admin-dashboard", "user-management", "api-management"]
```

### 2. Dynamic Rule Activation System

#### Enhanced Rule Discovery Protocol
```yaml
Phase 1: Industry Detection
  - Analyze project structure and keywords
  - Classify industry vertical
  - Load industry-specific rule sets

Phase 2: Compliance Mapping
  - Map industry to required compliance standards
  - Activate relevant compliance rules
  - Load security and audit patterns

Phase 3: Technology Optimization
  - Analyze technology stack
  - Load performance optimization rules
  - Activate security best practices

Phase 4: Context Caching
  - Cache industry classification results
  - Store rule activation patterns
  - Optimize for repeated access
```

### 3. Intelligent Rule Precedence Resolution

#### Rule Priority Matrix
```yaml
Priority Levels:
  1. Security & Compliance (F8 overlay)
  2. Industry-Specific Rules
  3. Master Rules (alwaysApply: true)
  4. Common Rules
  5. Project-Specific Rules

Conflict Resolution:
  - Higher priority rules override lower priority
  - Industry rules take precedence over generic rules
  - Security rules always take highest precedence
  - Document all overrides with reasoning
```

### 4. Performance Optimization

#### Context Caching System
```yaml
Cache Strategy:
  - Industry classification results (TTL: 1 hour)
  - Rule activation patterns (TTL: 30 minutes)
  - Project structure analysis (TTL: 15 minutes)
  - Compliance mapping (TTL: 2 hours)

Cache Invalidation:
  - File system changes trigger cache refresh
  - Rule file modifications invalidate related cache
  - Industry classification changes clear all cache
```

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Discovery Algorithm

```python
def enhanced_context_discovery(project_path, user_request):
    """
    Enhanced context discovery with industry intelligence
    """
    # Phase 1: Industry Classification
    industry = classify_industry(project_path, user_request)
    
    # Phase 2: Rule Inventory with Industry Focus
    rules = discover_rules_with_industry_focus(industry, project_path)
    
    # Phase 3: Compliance Mapping
    compliance_rules = map_compliance_requirements(industry)
    
    # Phase 4: Technology Stack Analysis
    tech_rules = analyze_technology_stack(project_path)
    
    # Phase 5: Context Caching
    cache_context(industry, rules, compliance_rules, tech_rules)
    
    return {
        'industry': industry,
        'rules': rules,
        'compliance': compliance_rules,
        'technology': tech_rules
    }
```

### Industry Classification Function

```python
def classify_industry(project_path, user_request):
    """
    Intelligent industry classification based on multiple signals
    """
    signals = {
        'keywords': extract_keywords(project_path, user_request),
        'tech_stack': analyze_tech_stack(project_path),
        'structure': analyze_project_structure(project_path),
        'dependencies': analyze_dependencies(project_path)
    }
    
    # Weighted scoring system
    scores = {}
    for industry, patterns in INDUSTRY_PATTERNS.items():
        score = calculate_industry_score(signals, patterns)
        scores[industry] = score
    
    return max(scores, key=scores.get)
```

### Compliance Mapping System

```python
def map_compliance_requirements(industry):
    """
    Map industry to required compliance standards
    """
    compliance_map = {
        'healthcare': ['HIPAA', 'FDA', 'HITECH'],
        'finance': ['SOX', 'PCI DSS', 'Basel III'],
        'ecommerce': ['GDPR', 'CCPA', 'PCI DSS'],
        'enterprise': ['SOC2', 'ISO27001', 'FedRAMP']
    }
    
    return compliance_map.get(industry, [])
```

## Integration with Existing System

### Backward Compatibility

The enhanced system maintains full backward compatibility with the existing context discovery protocol:

1. **Fallback Mode**: If industry classification fails, falls back to original protocol
2. **Rule Inheritance**: Industry rules extend existing master/common rules
3. **API Compatibility**: Same interface as existing discovery system

### Migration Path

```yaml
Phase 1: Parallel Operation
  - Run enhanced system alongside existing
  - Compare results and validate accuracy
  - Monitor performance impact

Phase 2: Gradual Rollout
  - Enable enhanced features for new projects
  - Migrate existing projects incrementally
  - Collect feedback and optimize

Phase 3: Full Migration
  - Replace original system
  - Remove legacy code
  - Update documentation
```

## Usage Examples

### Healthcare Project Detection
```bash
# Project with healthcare keywords and structure
python3 .cursor/dev-workflow/tools/enhanced-context-discovery.py \
  --project-path ./patient-portal \
  --request "Create patient data management system"

# Output:
# Industry: healthcare
# Activated Rules: healthcare-compliance, hipaa-patterns, patient-data-protection
# Compliance: HIPAA, HITECH
# Tech Stack: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL (encrypted)
```

### Finance Project Detection
