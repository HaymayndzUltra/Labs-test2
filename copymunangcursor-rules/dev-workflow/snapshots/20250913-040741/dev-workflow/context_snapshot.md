# Context Snapshot Specification

A `context_snapshot` is a compact, reproducible package generated by Context Discovery and passed between agents. It MUST include:

- `snapshot_id` (uuid)
- `git_commit` (commit SHA)
- `rules_manifest.json` (list of loaded rules with paths and checksums)
- top-level `README.md` contents (short extracts)
- `tech_fingerprint.json` (package.json / requirements.txt hints)
- `dependency_fingerprint.json` (lockfile digest or SBOM)

Snapshots are signed by the agent identity and stored temporarily under `/.cursor/dev-workflow/snapshots/` with retention policy documented in `README`.
