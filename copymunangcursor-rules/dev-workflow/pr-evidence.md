# Evidence Report: Governance Router Implementation

Generated: 2025-09-06

## Hygiene
- `rule_hygiene.py` ran: checked 280 files, 0 errors.

## Policy Linter
- `policy-dsl/lint_policy.py` ran: OK (policies present and valid).

## Routing Logs
- Router executed and produced routing log: sample file in `/.cursor/dev-workflow/routing_logs/`.
- `routing_log_check.py` validated routing logs with basic checks: OK.

## Waiver Flow
- `f8_waiver_check.py` validated `waivers/approved_sample_waiver.md`: OK.

## Snapshots
- `generate_snapshot.py` created snapshot: `snap-*.json` in `/.cursor/dev-workflow/snapshots/`.
- `context_snapshot_check.py` validated presence: OK.

## Simulations
- `tests/conflict_simulation.py` outcome: winner `p-high` as expected.

## Artifacts
- PR description: `/.cursor/dev-workflow/pr-description.md`
- Docs: `onboarding.md`, `router_contract.md`, `retention_and_security.md`

## Notes
- `router.py` is a starter stub; production router should expand condition evaluation and integrate into CI runtime.
- `policy-dsl/_schema` holds the schema to avoid being linted as a policy.
