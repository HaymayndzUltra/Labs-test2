# Upwork Proposal: Production News Feed Application

## Introduction
I'm a full-stack developer specializing in high-performance news aggregation systems and real-time data pipelines. I've built similar feed applications using TypeScript, Next.js, and PostgreSQL with sub-second query performance.

## Understanding of Project
You need a complete news feed application with RSS/API ingestion, content processing pipeline, and a performant UI. Key requirements include p95 query times under 1s, hourly ingestion cadence, and scalable architecture for 100+ sources using Encore/TypeScript and Next.js.

## Solution Approach
- **Backend**: Encore services for schedulers, extraction pipeline, and LLM classification
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL with GIN/tsvector indexing and keyset pagination for sub-1s queries
- **Frontend**: Next.js with Tailwind/ShadCN for high-performance feed UI
- **Processing**: Trafilatura/Readability extraction → de-duplication → Claude Code classification
- **Performance**: Optimized indexes, efficient query patterns, and caching strategies

## Value Proposition
I've delivered similar feed systems achieving p95 < 800ms through strategic indexing and query optimization. My experience includes PostgreSQL FTS with JSONB filters, content deduplication algorithms, and LLM integration for editorial classification. I specialize in Encore/TypeScript and have built scalable ingestion pipelines handling 10K+ articles daily.

## Call to Action
To keep things efficient, I'll structure everything into clear phases with goals, deliverables, and acceptance criteria. If you could share any specific requirements or reference materials upfront, I'll integrate them right away—so we finalize scope faster without needing long back-and-forth calls
