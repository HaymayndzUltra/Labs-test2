We are developing a secure multi-role web portal with role-based access, questionnaires, document management, and messaging. The system will include three roles:

User Portal – Registration, questionnaires, document uploads, and messaging.

Reviewer Portal – Manage assigned users, review submissions, and communicate with users.

Admin Portal – Oversee the platform, manage accounts, and monitor activity.

The portal must be secure, scalable, and user-friendly, with proper testing and deployment.
