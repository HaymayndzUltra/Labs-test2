### Proposal

#### Introduction
I‚Äôm a full‚Äëstack developer focused on AI SaaS. I can deliver your stack: Next.js/Node.js or FastAPI, PostgreSQL (multi‚Äëtenant) with Redis, OpenAI + Whisper + ElevenLabs, and Twilio Voice/SMS.

#### Understanding of Project
You need to extend an existing SaaS framework (not from scratch), brand it under your domain, and ship an MVP in 10‚Äì21 days covering AI auto‚Äëreceptionist, website chatbot/lead capture, automated follow‚Äëups, review/reputation management, competitor intelligence (SerpAPI/Reviewshake), ROI dashboards, and Stripe subscriptions.

#### Solution Approach
- Multi‚Äëtenant core with RBAC and master admin ‚Üí tenant onboarding, secure dashboards, unique logins; designed to scale to 50,000+ users.
- Communications: Twilio flows for missed‚Äëcall SMS and landline call‚Äëbacks; booking via AI agent with Google/Outlook Calendar sync; Whisper STT + ElevenLabs/Azure TTS.
- Growth loops: OpenAI chatbot, SMS/email sequences, no‚Äëshow reminders, 30/60/90‚Äëday win‚Äëbacks, loyalty/referral.
- Reputation and intel: Auto Google review requests, tracking across Google/Yelp/FB, AI‚Äësuggested responses; SerpAPI/Reviewshake summaries in dashboard and email.
- Billing and ops: Stripe subscription billing per client; Dockerized deployment on AWS/GCP/Azure; security with JWT/OAuth2 and encryption best practices.

#### Value Proposition
Crisp scope, parallelized integrations, and testable deliverables keep velocity high while preserving reliability, branding, and measurable outcomes (leads, conversions, revenue) from day one.

#### Call to Action
To keep things efficient, I‚Äôll structure everything into clear phases with goals, deliverables, and acceptance criteria. If you could share any specific requirements or reference materials upfront, I‚Äôll integrate them right away‚Äîso we finalize scope faster without needing long back-and-forth calls
