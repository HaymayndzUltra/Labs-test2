We are looking for an experienced Backend Developer to join our team building an AI-powered healthcare platform (orthopedic workers’ compensation, medical-legal workflow automation, insurer/EHR integrations). You’ll work with Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS, and RESTful APIs to deliver highly secure, scalable, and HIPAA-compliant features.

Project Highlights:

Node.js/Express backend (REST APIs)

PostgreSQL (AWS RDS)

AWS S3 (file storage), EC2

Role-based access control (multi-user, multi-clinic)

Workflow automation for reports, billing (CMS-1500), RFA, QME

EHR integration (FHIR/HL7 APIs)

Secure audit logs and compliance (HIPAA)

AI voice transcription (OpenAI Whisper, handled by separate team)

Modern Agile workflow, CI/CD, code reviews

Responsibilities

Design and develop scalable REST APIs (Node.js + Express)

Implement workflow logic: intake, report automation, RFA, billing, QME, audit trails

Build and optimize PostgreSQL schemas/queries

Integrate with EHR (FHIR/HL7 APIs), insurer APIs, and 3rd-party services (SendGrid, Firebase)

Ensure HIPAA-compliant security: role-based auth, data encryption, logging

Collaborate with frontend, AI, DevOps, and QA teams in sprints

Write clean, well-tested, well-documented code

Debug, optimize, and scale backend services on AWS

Must-Have Skills

Node.js + Express.js (3+ years)

PostgreSQL (schema design, query optimization)

REST API development, security best practices

Experience with AWS stack (EC2, S3, RDS, IAM)

Auth (JWT, OAuth), RBAC, and secure API design

Writing audit logs and compliance-ready code

Git, Jira (or equivalent Agile tools)

English communication (written, spoken)

Nice-to-Have

Experience in healthcare (EHR, FHIR/HL7, HIPAA) or fintech (high-compliance apps)

Billing/reporting automation (CMS-1500, QME, insurer workflow)

Voice or AI-based integrations (OpenAI Whisper, NLP, etc.)

DevOps/CI/CD knowledge (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)

Previous work on insurance or clinical platforms
