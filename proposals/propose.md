Participate in code reviews and contribute to improving development workflows and architecture.
Requirements
3+ years of professional experience as a Full Stack Developer.
Proficiency with React.js, including Hooks, functional components, and state management tools.
Solid experience with Node.js and Express.js for building backend services.
Strong knowledge of PostgreSQL, including schema design, indexing, and performance optimization.
Hands-on experience integrating or working with AI/ML APIs or models (e.g. OpenAI GPT, vector databases, embeddings).
Good understanding of software architecture and DevOps practices (Docker, GitHub Actions, etc.).
Familiarity with RESTful API design, authentication (JWT/OAuth), and basic security principles.
Strong problem-solving skills and ability to work in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.
Bonus Skills
Experience with LangChain, Pinecone, Qdrant, or other vector databases.
Experience with TypeScript.
Familiarity with serverless architecture (AWS Lambda, Vercel, etc.).
Understanding of prompt engineering and LLM lifecycle.
UI/UX sensitivity and experience working with design systems (e.g. TailwindCSS, Material UI).

## Proposal

Introduction — I’m a full‑stack engineer focused on React.js + Express.js, PostgreSQL, and AI integrations. Your need to blend OpenAI/Hugging Face with LangChain for a robust, scalable app fits well.

Understanding of Project — You’re seeking end‑to‑end delivery: React with Hooks, RESTful APIs, secure JWT/OAuth, optimized PostgreSQL, and CI/CD with Docker and GitHub Actions—plus TypeScript, vector databases, and optional serverless (Vercel/AWS Lambda).

Solution Approach —
- Frontend: Hooks‑based React, atomic components; TailwindCSS or Material UI per your system.
- Backend: Express.js APIs with validation, consistent error handling, and JWT/OAuth.
- Data/AI: PostgreSQL schema + indexing; integrate OpenAI/Hugging Face via LangChain; Pinecone/Qdrant if needed.
- DevOps: Dockerized services, GitHub Actions pipelines; monitor performance and scalability.

Value Proposition — You’ll get clean, testable code, security‑minded architecture, and collaborative delivery with frequent reviews and clear documentation.

To keep things efficient, I’ll structure everything into clear phases with goals, deliverables, and acceptance criteria. If you could share any specific requirements or reference materials upfront, I’ll integrate them right away—so we finalize scope faster without needing long back-and-forth calls
