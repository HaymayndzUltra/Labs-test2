# ML Baseline (Optional)

## Scope
If ML is introduced later, use this as a template.

## Baseline
- Task: N/A (placeholder)
- Dataset: define source and splits
- Metric: define primary (e.g., accuracy, F1), with target

## Evaluation
- Reproducible run: script/notebook with seed control
- Report: confusion matrix/PR curve as applicable

## Drift Monitoring Plan
- Data drift: PSI/KL across key features
- Performance drift: rolling window of primary metric
- Alerts: thresholds and notification channel
