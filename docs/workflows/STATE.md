# Workflow State — Phase 01 Inventory

## Scope
- Enumerate workflow docs and trigger commands
- Validate 1:1 mapping and detect inconsistencies
- Produce issues list with priorities and ownership

## Inventory
- Workflow docs discovered (docs/workflows/**/*.md):
  - docs/workflows/01_BRIEF_ANALYSIS/01_BRIEF_ANALYSIS.md
  - docs/workflows/02_TECHNICAL_PLANNING.md
  - docs/workflows/03_PROJECT_GENERATION.md
  - docs/workflows/04_FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md
  - docs/workflows/05_TESTING_QA.md
  - docs/workflows/06_DEPLOYMENT.md
  - docs/workflows/07_MAINTENANCE.md
  - docs/workflows/08_SECURITY_COMPLIANCE.md
  - docs/workflows/09_DOCUMENTATION.md
  - docs/workflows/10_MONITORING_OBSERVABILITY.md

- Trigger commands discovered (.cursor/rules/trigger-commands/*):
  - 01-brief-analysis.tc.mdc
  - 02-technical-planning.tc.mdc
  - 03-project-generation.tc.mdc
  - 04-feature-implementation.tc.mdc
  - 05-testing-qa.tc.mdc
  - 06-deployment.tc.mdc
  - 07-maintenance.tc.mdc
  - 08-security-compliance.tc.mdc
  - 09-documentation.tc.mdc
  - 10-monitoring-observability.tc.mdc

## Mapping & Validation
- Phase 01
  - Trigger Apply: "/docs/workflows/01_BRIEF_ANALYSIS.md" (leading slash; non-existent file)
  - Actual workflow: "docs/workflows/01_BRIEF_ANALYSIS/01_BRIEF_ANALYSIS.md"
  - Status: MISMATCH (critical)
- Phase 02 → Apply: docs/workflows/02_TECHNICAL_PLANNING.md (OK)
- Phase 03 → Apply: docs/workflows/03_PROJECT_GENERATION.md (OK)
- Phase 04 → Apply: docs/workflows/04_FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md (OK)
- Phase 05 → Apply: docs/workflows/05_TESTING_QA.md (OK)
- Phase 06 → Apply: docs/workflows/06_DEPLOYMENT.md (OK)
- Phase 07 → Apply: docs/workflows/07_MAINTENANCE.md (OK)
- Phase 08 → Apply: docs/workflows/08_SECURITY_COMPLIANCE.md (OK)
- Phase 09 → Apply: docs/workflows/09_DOCUMENTATION.md (OK)
- Phase 10 → Apply: docs/workflows/10_MONITORING_OBSERVABILITY.md (OK)

- Glob validation in triggers
  - Current: globs: "docs/workflows/*.md" (non-recursive)
  - Issue: misses nested path for Phase 01
  - Recommendation: use recursive: "docs/workflows/**/*.md"

## Content Quality Findings
- Missing sections
  - Phase 05 (docs/workflows/05_TESTING_QA.md): missing Overall Acceptance
  - Phase 06 (docs/workflows/06_DEPLOYMENT.md): missing Overall Acceptance
  - Phase 07 (docs/workflows/07_MAINTENANCE.md): missing Prerequisites, Evidence, Overall Acceptance
  - Phase 08 (docs/workflows/08_SECURITY_COMPLIANCE.md): missing Prerequisites, Overall Acceptance
  - Phase 09 (docs/workflows/09_DOCUMENTATION.md): missing Prerequisites, Evidence, Overall Acceptance
  - Phase 10 (docs/workflows/10_MONITORING_OBSERVABILITY.md): missing Prerequisites, Evidence, Overall Acceptance
- Formatting/consistency
  - Phase 01 is nested (subfolder) while others are flat (OK if glob is recursive)
  - Phase 01 Apply path in trigger has leading slash (inconsistent with others)
  - Phase 02 includes duplicated "Cursor Rules relevant…" block at bottom (noise)

## Issues List (Prioritized)
- Critical
  - Fix Phase 01 trigger Apply path to: "docs/workflows/01_BRIEF_ANALYSIS/01_BRIEF_ANALYSIS.md" (remove leading slash)
    - Owner: Rules Maintainer
  - Update all trigger globs to recursive: "docs/workflows/**/*.md"
    - Owner: Rules Maintainer
- High
  - Add missing sections per phase (see findings above)
    - Owner: Docs Maintainer
  - Standardize acceptance thresholds (coverage ≥ 80%, perf p95 ≤ 500ms, 0 critical vulns, UAT sign-off by role)
    - Owner: Docs Maintainer
- Normal
  - Remove duplicated rules appendix from 02_TECHNICAL_PLANNING.md
    - Owner: Docs Maintainer
  - Normalize Apply path formatting (no leading slash across triggers)
    - Owner: Rules Maintainer
  - Add "Failure Modes & Troubleshooting" to phases lacking it
    - Owner: Docs Maintainer
  - Add cross-links (Related Phases) and optional "Paths & Artifacts" sections
    - Owner: Docs Maintainer

## Decision: Phase 01 Path Resolution
- Chosen solution: FIX TRIGGERS (do not flatten docs)
  - Update Apply to: "docs/workflows/01_BRIEF_ANALYSIS/01_BRIEF_ANALYSIS.md"
  - Make glob recursive: "docs/workflows/**/*.md"
  - Remove leading slash for consistency

## Acceptance Checklist (Phase 01)
- [x] Inventory report created: docs/workflows/STATE.md
- [x] Path mismatch for Phase 01 identified and solution chosen (fix triggers; recursive globs)
- [x] Consolidated issues list with owners and priorities

## Notes / Deviations
- None beyond identified issues; no blockers to proceed to Phase 02.

# Phase 03 — Project Generation (Scaffolds) Results

## Deliverables Created
- scripts/validate_workflows.py (CLI with --help, --list, --frontmatter, --sections, --all, --dry-run)
- Makefile workflow targets: workflow.phase.{1..10}
- gates_config.yaml (seed values aligned to success metrics)
- STATE.md (this file) updated with Phase 03 results

## Verification
- help output: OK (prints usage via python3 scripts/validate_workflows.py)
- dry-run OK: make workflow.phase.1 / workflow.phase.3 executed and printed sample failures
- compilation: OK (python3 -m py_compile scripts/validate_workflows.py)
- known missing-section case detected (e.g., Failure Modes/Overall Acceptance absent in several phases)

## Issues / Deviations
- Environment uses python3 (python not available). Makefile targets updated to use python3.
- Validator currently uses naive YAML parsing (sufficient for presence checks; robust parsing can be added later if needed).

## Acceptance (Phase 03)
- [x] Files exist and run locally (help output / dry-run OK)
- [x] make workflow.phase.1 prints intended checks
- [x] validator catches a known missing-section test case
