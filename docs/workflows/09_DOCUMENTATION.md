# Documentation Workflow

## Overview
Create and maintain developer and operational documentation aligned to generated code.

## Steps

### Step 1: Developer Docs
Action: Update `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`, API docs, READMEs
Acceptance:
- [ ] Docs reflect current stack and commands

### Step 2: Operational Docs
Action: Add deployment/runbook/troubleshooting sections
Acceptance:
- [ ] Runbook and troubleshooting complete

### Step 3: Change Log
Action: Maintain release notes
Acceptance:
- [ ] Changes linked to PRs/tickets

## Evidence
- Links to updated docs and runbook
- Release notes changelog entries

## Related Docs
- Development Guide: `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Runbook: `RUNBOOK.md`
- Contributing: `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## Failure Modes & Troubleshooting
- Docs drift → schedule doc reviews on major merges; link PRs
- Runbook gaps → add incident procedures and escalation paths

## Overall Acceptance
- [ ] Developer docs reflect current stack and commands
- [ ] Runbook and troubleshooting complete
- [ ] Change log entries linked to PRs/tickets
- [ ] Related Phases: 06 (deploy/runbook), 07 (ops updates)
