## Prerequisites
- Generated project context available
- Validation tools present (.cursor/tools/*)

# Security & Compliance Workflow

## Overview
Validate compliance rules presence, enforce security controls, and ensure CI gates are configured per industry.

## Steps

### Step 1: Rules Presence
Execute:
- `python .cursor/tools/check_compliance.py` (in generated project)
Acceptance:
- [ ] Required compliance rules present

### Step 2: Controls Validation
Action: Confirm encryption at rest/in transit, RBAC, audit logging, session timeout
Acceptance:
- [ ] Controls documented and mapped

Required controls (HIPAA):
- Encryption at rest (e.g., AES-256)
- Encryption in transit (TLS/HTTPS)
- RBAC (role-based access control)
- Audit logging for PHI access/changes
- Session timeout ≥ 15 minutes

### Step 3: CI Gates
Action: Review `gates_config.yaml` and security scans
Acceptance:
- [ ] Gates enabled and thresholds set

## Evidence
- Compliance checklist; gates config snapshot
  - `validation/compliance_report.json` (automated doc controls report)

## Failure Modes & Troubleshooting
- Missing controls → add/verify encryption, RBAC, audit logging, session timeout
- CI gates not enforced → ensure jobs read gates_config.yaml and fail on breach

## Overall Acceptance
- [ ] Required rules present and validated
- [ ] Controls documented and mapped
- [ ] CI gates enabled with thresholds set
- [ ] Related Phases: 02 (planning), 05 (gates), 06 (pre-deploy)
