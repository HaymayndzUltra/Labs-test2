# Discovery Brief — F1 Discovery & Intake

- Traceability ID: DISC-BRIEF-001
- Version: 0.1 (Initial Draft)
- Date: TBD
- Author: Background Agent
- Project: TBD

## Objective
Synthesize the problem definition, constraints, KPIs, and risks into an actionable discovery brief to inform PRD and UX.

## Scope
- In-scope: Discovery of needs, constraints, and success criteria for TBD.
- Out-of-scope: Detailed technical implementation, production rollout decisions.

## Context Summary
- Reviewed repository context and framework documentation.
- Sources consulted:
  - README (project framework overview, governance approach)
  - Security & Compliance Overlay (global constraints)
  - Background Agent Prompt F1 — Discovery & Intake
  - Master rules (collaboration, code quality, documentation)
- Not found: `dev-workflow/0-master-planner-output.md` (TBD if exists elsewhere)

## Interview Plan
- Objectives
  - Validate goals, constraints, and success criteria
  - Uncover risks, dependencies, and domain-specific requirements
- Cadence & Format
  - 45–60 minutes per stakeholder group; record decisions and action items
- Sample Questions
  - What outcomes make this initiative a success for you? How will you measure them?
  - What constraints are non-negotiable (security, privacy, performance, budget, timeline)?
  - What prior attempts or related initiatives should we learn from?
  - What are the biggest risks or blockers you foresee?
  - What dependencies (teams, vendors, systems) could affect timelines?

## Problem Statements
- PS-1: Inconsistent quality from AI-assisted changes increases review load and defects. Today, reviewers spend TBD% more time on AI-generated PRs.
- PS-2: Lack of codified architecture and rules causes rework and divergence across teams.
- PS-3: Compliance requirements (privacy, audit) are not fully automated in the development workflow, adding manual effort and risk.

## Success Metrics (KPIs)
- KPI-1: First-pass quality gate pass rate
  - Definition: % of PRs passing all checks on first CI run
  - Baseline: TBD | Target: +X pp increase
- KPI-2: Lead time for change
  - Definition: Time from first commit to merge
  - Baseline: TBD | Target: −Y%
- KPI-3: Rule violation detection rate pre-merge
  - Definition: % violations caught by automated checks before review
  - Baseline: TBD | Target: +Z%
- KPI-4: Escaped defect rate (30/90 days)
  - Definition: Defects reaching production attributable to process gaps
  - Baseline: TBD | Target: −W%
- KPI-5: Developer productivity uplift
  - Definition: Stories/points per engineer per sprint (normalized)
  - Baseline: TBD | Target: +U%
- KPI-6: Security & privacy compliance adherence
  - Definition: Checklist coverage and audit event completeness
  - Baseline: TBD | Target: 100% coverage; 0 critical gaps

## Constraints & Non-Functional Requirements
- Security & Privacy (from overlay):
  - Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest; no hardcoded secrets
  - Access controls, audit logging, change tracking, incident response readiness
  - Data minimization, consent, retention, right-to-deletion where applicable
- Quality & Maintainability:
  - Clear governance rules; documentation kept in-repo; traceability for decisions
  - Automated checks in CI/CD; observability for performance and reliability
- Performance & UX:
  - Targets TBD; monitor LCP/INP for UI work; service-level objectives for APIs

## Assumptions
- A single source of truth for rules and documentation will be maintained in-repo
- CI/CD is available for enforcing checks and collecting metrics
- Stakeholders can be scheduled within two weeks for interviews

## Dependencies
- Access to current architecture docs and team calendars
- Integration with CI/CD, code scanning, and telemetry tools
- Availability of security/compliance policies and contacts

## Risks & Mitigations (Summary)
- R-1: Ambiguous goals lead to scope drift — Mitigation: upfront alignment, signed brief
- R-2: Tooling gaps delay automation — Mitigation: phased rollout, MVP gates
- R-3: Compliance gaps discovered late — Mitigation: early security/privacy review

## Acceptance Criteria
- Discovery Brief approved by Product and Engineering (sign-off recorded)
- KPIs and targets agreed; measurement plan defined
- RAD register created and prioritized with owners

## Handoff & Next Steps
- Produce PRD inputs (objectives, scope, constraints, KPIs)
- Provide UX inputs (user flows, key states, accessibility considerations)
- Plan implementation phases and validation checkpoints
