A cross‑platform e‑commerce analytics dashboard that consolidates marketplace performance (e.g., Shopee, Tokopedia, Amazon, Lazada) into a single source of truth. It surfaces funnel KPIs (views → cart → checkout → re‑order), revenue and gross profit trends, platform distribution, category performance, customer insights, and feedback—designed for merchandisers, growth, and operations to make faster, data‑driven decisions.
Background & Rationale
Fragmented data across marketplaces and ad channels leads to slow and inconsistent reporting.
Operational visibility gap: teams lack real‑time view of revenue, conversion drop‑offs, and category winners.
Scalability: manual spreadsheets don’t scale as SKU count and markets grow.
Decision velocity: leadership needs week/month/quarter rollups and exportable summaries for planning.
Goals & Success Criteria
Single source of truth: 95%+ data completeness with <0.5% reconciliation variance vs. platform reports.
Faster decisions: reduce time‑to‑insight from days to <1 hour; p95 dashboard load <3s.
Growth impact: +2–5% MoM increase in checkout conversion; +3% re‑order rate within 6 months.
Adoption: ≥80% WAU among target business users; ≥90% of weekly business reviews reference the dashboard.
Governance: metric dictionary and audit logging in place; versioned transformations with rollback.
Scope & Deliverables
In scope
Data ingestion from prioritized marketplaces and web analytics.
Modeled metrics for funnel, revenue, profit, categories, platforms, and NPS/feedback.
Interactive dashboard: KPI cards, platform view, revenue charts with time selectors, category bars, customer insights, feedback score, best seller list, search, and export.
Role‑based access, auditing, and metric documentation.
Alerts for anomalies (optional pilot).
Out of scope (v1)
Predictive forecasting, LTV modeling, marketing MMM.
Write‑back to source systems, inventory ops automations.
Custom per‑team dashboards beyond agreed templates.
Features & Functionality
Global
Search, time range toggles (week/month/quarter), CSV/PNG export, role‑based views.
KPI cards
Product viewed, product viewed (unique), added to cart, checked out, re‑ordered.
Vs. last period deltas; each card drill‑downs by platform, category, SKU.
Platform view
Bar/column chart by marketplace with totals (e.g., Shopee 450.2K).
Distribution tooltip (percent split by platform); “Add platforms +” to include new channels.
Revenue tracking
Total revenue line with trend and variance; expected vs. actual gross profit.
Time selectors: this week/month/quarter; hover for daily granularity.
Top performing categories
Ranked bars by revenue growth; click to filter the whole dashboard.
Customer insights
“Most users by country” panel with average rating (e.g., 4.7) and review volume.
Feedback score
Overall positive feedback percentage; track trend and thresholds.
Best seller
Top SKUs by units/revenue, stock status, contribution to total; link to SKU detail.
Timeline / Milestones (12–14 weeks)
W1: Discovery & requirements — stakeholder interviews, metric definitions, success targets.
W2–3: Data integration — connectors, schema landing, initial QA.
W4–5: Data modeling — dbt/star schema, metric layer, tests.
W6: Design — UX flows, Figma, accessibility review.
W7–9: Build — visuals, filters, RBAC, exports, logging.
W10: QA & data validation — unit/integration tests, reconciliation against source reports.
W11: UAT & training — playbooks, documentation, feedback triage.
W12: Launch — production rollout, SLOs, alerting; 2 weeks hypercare (W13–14).
Stakeholders & Roles
Executive Sponsor: vision, unblockers, success criteria sign‑off.
Product Manager (Owner): requirements, backlog, roadmap, adoption.
Data Engineer: ingestion, orchestration, reliability, SLAs.
Analytics Engineer: modeling, metric layer, tests, documentation.

Risks & Mitigation
Data quality/inconsistency: implement source‑of‑truth definitions, automated tests, reconciliation dashboards.
API limits or schema drift: rate‑limit aware ingestion, schema versioning, contract tests.
Metric ambiguity: metric council with documented definitions and change control.
Performance: aggregate tables/materialized views, query caching, p95 SLOs.
Adoption risk: early stakeholder reviews, training, embedded usage tips.
Compliance/PII: minimize data, mask as needed, enforce RBAC and auditing.
Scope creep: phase gates and change‑request process.
