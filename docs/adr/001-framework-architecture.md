# ADR-001: Framework Architecture Decision

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The AI Governor Framework Enhancement requires a scalable, maintainable architecture that can support multiple industry verticals, compliance requirements, and component reuse across projects.

## Decision
We will implement a modular, microservices-based architecture with the following key components:

1. **Project Generator Engine**: Core service for generating industry-specific projects
2. **Dynamic Rule Engine**: Context-aware rule activation and enforcement
3. **Component Library System**: Reusable component management and distribution
4. **Portfolio Management Dashboard**: Multi-project coordination and resource management
5. **Industry-Specific Modules**: Healthcare, Finance, E-commerce, Enterprise compliance modules

## Rationale
- **Modularity**: Each component can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
- **Scalability**: Microservices architecture allows horizontal scaling of individual components
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the system easier to maintain and extend
- **Compliance**: Industry-specific modules ensure proper compliance implementation
- **Reusability**: Component library system enables code reuse across projects

## Consequences
### Positive
- High scalability and performance
- Easy to add new industry modules
- Clear separation of concerns
- Independent component development
- Better resource utilization

### Negative
- Increased complexity in service communication
- More complex deployment and monitoring
- Potential data consistency challenges
- Higher operational overhead

## Implementation
- Use containerized microservices (Docker)
- Implement service mesh for communication (Istio)
- Use API Gateway for external access
- Implement centralized logging and monitoring
- Use event-driven architecture for loose coupling
