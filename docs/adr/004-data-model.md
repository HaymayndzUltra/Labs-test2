# ADR-004: Data Model Decision

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The framework needs to store and manage projects, rules, components, compliance data, and user information while maintaining data integrity and supporting complex queries.

## Decision
We will use a relational database (PostgreSQL) with the following design principles:

1. **Normalized Schema**: Proper normalization to reduce data redundancy
2. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all data changes
3. **Row-Level Security**: Database-level access controls
4. **Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
5. **Versioning**: Support for data versioning and migration

## Rationale
- **ACID Properties**: Relational databases provide strong consistency guarantees
- **Complex Queries**: SQL supports complex analytical queries
- **Mature Ecosystem**: PostgreSQL has excellent tooling and support
- **Compliance**: Relational databases support compliance requirements well
- **Performance**: PostgreSQL provides excellent performance for complex queries

## Consequences
### Positive
- Strong data consistency
- Complex query support
- Mature tooling and ecosystem
- Good compliance support
- Excellent performance

### Negative
- Schema changes require migrations
- Potential performance issues with complex queries
- Higher operational overhead
- Limited horizontal scaling

## Implementation
- Design normalized database schema
- Implement audit logging triggers
- Set up row-level security policies
- Configure encryption for sensitive data
- Create data migration procedures
