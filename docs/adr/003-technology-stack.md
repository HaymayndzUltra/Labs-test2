# ADR-003: Technology Stack Decision

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The framework needs to integrate with existing Cursor-based development workflows while providing modern, scalable technology for project generation and management.

## Decision
We will use the following technology stack:

**Core Framework:**
- Python 3.9+ for automation and scripting
- Jinja2 for template rendering
- PostgreSQL for data storage
- Redis for caching and session management
- FastAPI for API development

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- MinIO for object storage
- Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring
- ELK stack for logging

**Frontend:**
- Next.js for generated projects
- React for component library
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling

**Backend:**
- FastAPI for generated project APIs
- PostgreSQL for generated project databases
- Redis for caching
- Celery for background tasks

## Rationale
- **Integration**: Python integrates well with existing Cursor workflows
- **Performance**: FastAPI provides high performance for APIs
- **Scalability**: Kubernetes enables horizontal scaling
- **Maintainability**: Modern, well-documented technologies
- **Community**: Large community support and ecosystem
- **Compliance**: Technologies support security and compliance requirements

## Consequences
### Positive
- High performance and scalability
- Good integration with existing tools
- Strong community support
- Modern development practices
- Good security and compliance support

### Negative
- Learning curve for team members
- Potential over-engineering for simple use cases
- Higher operational complexity
- Dependency on multiple technologies

## Implementation
- Set up development environment with chosen technologies
- Create CI/CD pipeline with Docker and Kubernetes
- Implement monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Establish development standards and practices
- Create documentation and training materials
