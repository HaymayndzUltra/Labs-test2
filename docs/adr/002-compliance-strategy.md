# ADR-002: Compliance Strategy Decision

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The framework must support multiple industry compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOX, PCI DSS, GDPR, CCPA, SOC2) while maintaining flexibility for future regulatory changes.

## Decision
We will implement a compliance-first architecture with the following approach:

1. **Industry-Specific Compliance Modules**: Separate modules for each industry vertical
2. **Automated Compliance Implementation**: Built-in compliance patterns and controls
3. **Continuous Compliance Monitoring**: Real-time compliance validation and reporting
4. **Compliance as Code**: Compliance requirements defined as code and versioned
5. **Expert Validation**: Industry expert consultation during development

## Rationale
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Different industries have specific compliance requirements
- **Automation**: Manual compliance implementation is error-prone and time-consuming
- **Consistency**: Automated compliance ensures consistent implementation across projects
- **Auditability**: Compliance as code provides clear audit trails
- **Expertise**: Industry experts ensure compliance accuracy and completeness

## Consequences
### Positive
- Reduced compliance implementation time
- Consistent compliance across projects
- Automated compliance validation
- Clear audit trails
- Reduced compliance risk

### Negative
- Increased development complexity
- Higher initial development cost
- Need for ongoing compliance updates
- Requires industry expertise
- Potential over-engineering for simple projects

## Implementation
- Create compliance rule engine for each industry
- Implement automated compliance checking
- Build compliance reporting dashboard
- Establish expert consultation process
- Create compliance testing framework
