# ADR-005: Security Approach Decision

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The framework handles sensitive data including PHI, financial information, and compliance data, requiring robust security measures to protect against threats and ensure regulatory compliance.

## Decision
We will implement a defense-in-depth security approach with the following layers:

1. **Network Security**: VPC, load balancers, WAF, DDoS protection
2. **Application Security**: Authentication, authorization, input validation, output encoding
3. **Data Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit, key management, data masking
4. **Compliance Security**: Audit logging, access controls, data retention, incident response
5. **Monitoring Security**: SIEM, threat detection, vulnerability management, security analytics

## Rationale
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Multiple compliance frameworks require comprehensive security
- **Threat Landscape**: Modern applications face sophisticated threats
- **Data Sensitivity**: Handling PHI and financial data requires highest security standards
- **Trust**: Security is critical for client confidence and business success
- **Compliance**: Security controls are required for regulatory compliance

## Consequences
### Positive
- Strong protection against threats
- Regulatory compliance support
- Client confidence and trust
- Reduced security risk
- Comprehensive audit trails

### Negative
- Increased development complexity
- Higher operational overhead
- Potential performance impact
- Additional cost for security tools
- Ongoing security maintenance

## Implementation
- Implement network security controls
- Build application security features
- Configure data encryption and key management
- Set up compliance monitoring and reporting
- Establish security incident response procedures
