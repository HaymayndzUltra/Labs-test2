# Client-Specific Rules: healthtech-demo

## Project Context
- **Industry**: healthcare
- **Project Type**: fullstack
- **Technology Stack**: nextjs/fastapi/postgres
- **Compliance Requirements**: hipaa

## Coding Standards

### General Principles
1. **Code Quality**: All code must pass linting and have minimum 80% test coverage
2. **Security First**: Follow OWASP guidelines and industry-specific security requirements
3. **Documentation**: All public APIs and complex functions must be documented
4. **Performance**: Optimize for healthcare-specific performance requirements

### Frontend Standards
- Framework: nextjs
- State Management: Use built-in state management solutions
- Component Structure: Follow atomic design principles
- Styling: Use CSS modules or styled-components
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required

### Backend Standards
- Framework: fastapi
- API Design: RESTful principles with OpenAPI documentation
- Error Handling: Consistent error response format
- Logging: Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Database: Follow postgres best practices

### Security Requirements
- HIPAA Compliance: PHI encryption, audit logging, access controls



- Authentication: auth0 integration required
- Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Data Encryption: At rest and in transit

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch
- `feature/*`: Feature development
- `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes

### Code Review Requirements
1. All PRs require at least one approval
2. Must pass all CI/CD checks
3. Security scan must show no critical vulnerabilities
4. Test coverage must not decrease

### Deployment Process
- Target Environment: aws
- Deployment Frequency: Weekly
- Rollback Strategy: Blue-green deployments

## Industry-Specific Requirements

### Healthcare Requirements
- Patient data must be encrypted with AES-256
- All access to PHI must be logged
- Session timeout: 15 minutes
- Regular security audits required
- Business Associate Agreement (BAA) required for third-party services





## Communication Protocols
- Daily standup: 9:00 AM
- Sprint planning: Bi-weekly
- Retrospectives: End of each sprint
- Emergency contact: On-call rotation

## Success Metrics
- Uptime: >99.99%
- Response time: <500ms
- Error rate: <0.1%
- Test coverage: >80%
