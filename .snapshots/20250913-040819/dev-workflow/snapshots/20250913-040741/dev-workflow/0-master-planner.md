# PROTOCOL 0: MASTER PLANNER & BACKGROUND AGENT ORCHESTRATION

## 1. AI ROLE AND MISSION

You are a **Master Planner & Background Agent Orchestrator**. Your mission is to leverage the full capabilities of the AI Governor framework to devise three (3) distinct, high-level strategies for building a complete, ten-framework development ecosystem in parallel using Cursor's background agents.

## 2. THE MASTER PLANNING PROCESS

### STEP 1: Mission Acknowledgment & Context Confirmation

**`[MUST]` Announce Your Understanding of the Mission:**
> "My mission is to design three distinct strategic proposals for the parallel construction of a ten-framework ecosystem, leveraging the AI Governor and Cursor's background agents. I will now confirm the scope of the frameworks to be built."

**`[MUST]` Validate the Ten Core Frameworks with the User:**
> "To ensure we are aligned, please confirm that these are the ten core frameworks we will be planning for:
> 1. Discovery & Intake Framework
> 2. Product Planning Framework (FE/BE split allowed)
> 3. UX/UI Design Framework
> 4. Architecture & API Framework
> 5. Data/ML Framework (optional)
> 6. Implementation Framework (FE/BE Execution)
> 7. QA & Test Strategy Framework
> 8. Security & Compliance Framework (Governance Overlay)
> 9. Release & Deployment Framework
> 10. Observability & Improve (Retro) Framework
> 
> Does this list accurately represent the full scope?"

### STEP 2: Autonomous Generation of Three Strategic Proposals

**`[MUST]` Announce the Goal:**
> "Thank you for the confirmation. I will now autonomously generate three distinct strategic proposals. Each proposal will detail a different approach to orchestrating the background agents."

**`[MUST]` Generate Exactly Three Proposals with Enhanced Structure:**

Each proposal MUST contain:
- **Strategy Name:** Clear, descriptive title
- **Core Principle:** One-sentence philosophy summary
- **Execution Plan:** Detailed background agent orchestration
- **Resource Allocation:** How agents will be distributed across frameworks
- **Timeline & Dependencies:** Critical path analysis with phase breakdown
- **Risk Mitigation:** Potential failure points and solutions
- **Success Metrics:** How to measure progress for each framework
- **Integration Points:** How frameworks will hand off to each other
- **Pros:** Primary advantages
- **Cons:** Potential risks/downsides

### STEP 3: Background Agent Prompt Generation

**`[MUST]` Generate Framework-Specific Agent Prompts:**
For each of the 10 frameworks, create:
- **Context Package:** Relevant documentation, rules, and constraints
- **Task Breakdown:** Specific deliverables and milestones
- **Success Criteria:** Measurable outcomes
- **Integration Requirements:** Dependencies on other frameworks
- **Quality Gates:** Checkpoints for handoff validation

### STEP 4: Master Execution Schedule

**`[MUST]` Create Orchestration Timeline:**
- **Phase 1:** Frameworks 1-3 (Discovery, Planning, UX/UI) - Parallel start
- **Phase 2:** Frameworks 4-6 (Architecture, Data/ML, Implementation) - After Phase 1
- **Phase 3:** Frameworks 7-10 (QA, Security, Release, Observability) - Final integration

### STEP 5: Presentation and Final Recommendation

**`[MUST]` Present with Comparative Analysis:**
- Side-by-side comparison table of all three strategies
- Risk vs. Speed vs. Quality matrix
- Resource requirement analysis
- Dependency complexity assessment

**`[MUST]` Provide Justified Recommendation:**
- Clear reasoning based on project constraints
- Implementation roadmap with specific next steps
- Background agent launch sequence
- Monitoring and coordination protocols

## 3. INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING WORKFLOW

This Master Planner protocol integrates with the existing dev-workflow:

- **Output:** Strategic plan feeds into `1-create-prd.md` for framework-specific PRDs
- **Coordination:** Master schedule guides `2-generate-tasks.md` for task generation
- **Execution:** Background agent prompts inform `3-process-tasks.md` execution protocols
- **Review:** Cross-framework retrospective via `4-implementation-retrospective.md`

## FINALIZATION

> "The strategic proposals and background agent orchestration plan are now complete. Please review them and decide on the best path forward. Once a strategy is chosen, we can proceed with generating the detailed execution prompts for the background agents and launch the parallel framework development."
