- AP → Freeze plan; GO: LA + LB (+ LC if HIPAA).
- LA → Backend: scaffold, contracts, error envelope, authz, audit; stop on migration/security waivers.
- LB → Frontend: shell, auth flows/guards, a11y/perf acceptance.
- LC → Compliance: session timeout 15m, PHI encryption, audit trails.
- QA → Tests ≥80%, lints, SCA/SAST, SBOM; block criticals.
- PR → PR description and evidence bundle.
