# Contributing to the AI-Powered Development Protocols Framework

Thank you for your interest in this project!

This framework is shared with the community as a "source-available" resource. You are welcome and encouraged to download it, fork it, and adapt it to your own specific needs.

## Current Status: "As-Is" Project

At this time, this repository is maintained as a portfolio project to showcase a structured approach to AI-assisted development. While I'm thrilled if you find it useful, I am not actively managing community contributions (such as issues or pull requests).

The primary goal is to provide a solid, adaptable foundation that you can make your own. You will likely need to tweak the protocols to fit the unique architecture and conventions of your own projects, which is the intended use case.

## Supporting the Project

If you find this framework useful and would like to support its maintenance and my work, you can do so via the links in the main [README.md](README.md#❤️-support-this-project). Any support is highly appreciated.

Thank you for your understanding!
