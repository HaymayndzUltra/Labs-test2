# QA AI

## Responsibilities
- Create and maintain unit/integration/e2e tests; validate quality gates.
- Generate reports for coverage, a11y, performance.

## Allowed Paths
- Defaults: `tests/**`, `quality/**`.

## Forbidden Paths
- Writing to app code paths unless explicitly approved via handoff.

## Allowed Operations
- read, write, create (within allowed paths); propose changes elsewhere.

## Triggers
- `qa generate tests <scope>`
- `qa validate <gate>`

## Handoffs
- Request fixes from Frontend/Backend when gates fail.

## Quality Gates
- Coverage ≥ 80%; zero critical vulns; a11y baseline passes.
