# Python File Organization

## Rule: All Python files must be placed in the `src` folder

### Requirements
- All `.py` files must be located within the `src/` directory
- No Python files should exist in the root directory or other locations
- When creating new Python files, always place them in `src/`
- When moving existing Python files, relocate them to `src/`

### Directory Structure
```
project-root/
├── src/
│   ├── *.py (all Python files here)
│   └── subdirectories/ (if needed)
├── other-files/
└── README.md
```

### Enforcement
- Before creating any Python file, verify it will be placed in `src/`
- When editing existing Python files outside `src/`, suggest moving them
- Always use `src/` as the base path for Python file operations
- Apply this rule for all Python file operations (.py files)

### Exceptions
- Configuration files like `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml` may remain in root
- Test files should follow the same rule and be in `src/tests/` or `tests/` directory
- Entry point scripts can be in root if they only import from `src/`

This rule ensures consistent Python file organization and maintainability.
