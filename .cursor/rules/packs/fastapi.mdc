# Pack: FastAPI

## API Contracts
- Single error envelope (code,message,details,correlationId).
- OpenAPI must describe all endpoints; tags and examples required.

## Middleware
- Correlation IDs; structured logging; size limits; content-type validation.

## Testing
- Use dependency_overrides; fixture data builders; contract tests for critical endpoints.
