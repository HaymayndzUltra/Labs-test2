# Pack: HIPAA

## Technical Safeguards
- Unique user IDs; idle auto-logoff at 15 minutes; PHI encryption at rest (AES-256) and TLS 1.2+ in transit.
- Audit access to PHI with identity, action, objects; retention policy.
- Integrity controls (hash/sign) for PHI modifications; versioning where needed.
