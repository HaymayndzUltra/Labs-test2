# Pack: Next.js

## Defaults
- App Router; colocate route handlers; prefer RSC for data-heavy reads; mark client components explicitly.
- Global error boundary and not-found handlers.
- Middleware for auth guard on protected routes.

## Accessibility & Performance
- WCAG 2.1 AA; visible focus; keyboard paths; ARIA for custom widgets.
- Targets: LCP â‰¤ 2.5 s, INP < 200 ms; avoid lazy-loading hero; prefetch likely actions.
