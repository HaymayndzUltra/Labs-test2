Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical Python code with accurate examples.
- Use functional programming patterns; avoid unnecessary use of classes.
- Prefer vectorized operations over explicit loops for performance.
- Use descriptive variable names (e.g., `learning_rate`, `weights`, `gradients`).
- Organize code into functions and modules for clarity and reusability.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.

JAX Best Practices

- Leverage JAX's functional API for numerical computations.
 - Use `jax.numpy` instead of standard NumPy to ensure compatibility.
- Utilize automatic differentiation with `jax.grad` and `jax.value_and_grad`.
 - Write functions suitable for differentiation (i.e., functions with inputs as arrays and outputs as scalars when computing gradients).
- Apply `jax.jit` for just-in-time compilation to optimize performance.
 - Ensure functions are compatible with JIT (e.g., avoid Python side-effects and unsupported operations).
- Use `jax.vmap` for vectorizing functions over batch dimensions.
 - Replace explicit loops with `vmap` for operations over arrays.
- Avoid in-place mutations; JAX arrays are immutable.
 - Refrain from operations that modify arrays in place.
- Use pure functions without side effects to ensure compatibility with JAX transformations.

Optimization and Performance

- Write code that is compatible with JIT compilation; avoid Python constructs that JIT cannot compile.
 - Minimize the use of Python loops and dynamic control flow; use JAX's control flow operations like `jax.lax.scan`, `jax.lax.cond`, and `jax.lax.fori_loop`.
- Optimize memory usage by leveraging efficient data structures and avoiding unnecessary copies.
- Use appropriate data types (e.g., `float32`) to optimize performance and memory usage.
- Profile code to identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.

Error Handling and Validation

- Validate input shapes and data types before computations.
 - Use assertions or raise exceptions for invalid inputs.
- Provide informative error messages for invalid inputs or computational errors.
- Handle exceptions gracefully to prevent crashes during execution.

Testing and Debugging

- Write unit tests for functions using testing frameworks like `pytest`.
 - Ensure correctness of mathematical computations and transformations.
- Use `jax.debug.print` for debugging JIT-compiled functions.
- Be cautious with side effects and stateful operations; JAX expects pure functions for transformations.

Documentation

- Include docstrings for functions and modules following PEP 257 conventions.
 - Provide clear descriptions of function purposes, arguments, return values, and examples.
- Comment on complex or non-obvious code sections to improve readability and maintainability.

Key Conventions

- Naming Conventions
 - Use `snake_case` for variable and function names.
 - Use `UPPERCASE` for constants.
- Function Design
 - Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
 - Avoid global variables; pass parameters explicitly.
- File Structure
 - Organize code into modules and packages logically.
 - Separate utility functions, core algorithms, and application code.

JAX Transformations

- Pure Functions
 - Ensure functions are free of side effects for compatibility with `jit`, `grad`, `vmap`, etc.
- Control Flow
 - Use JAX's control flow operations (`jax.lax.cond`, `jax.lax.scan`) instead of Python control flow in JIT-compiled functions.
- Random Number Generation
 - Use JAX's PRNG system; manage random keys explicitly.
- Parallelism
 - Utilize `jax.pmap` for parallel computations across multiple devices when available.

Performance Tips

- Benchmarking
 - Use tools like `timeit` and JAX's built-in benchmarking utilities.
- Avoiding Common Pitfalls
 - Be mindful of unnecessary data transfers between CPU and GPU.
 - Watch out for compiling overhead; reuse JIT-compiled functions when possible.

Best Practices

- Immutability
 - Embrace functional programming principles; avoid mutable states.
- Reproducibility
 - Manage random seeds carefully for reproducible results.
- Version Control
 - Keep track of library versions (`jax`, `jaxlib`, etc.) to ensure compatibility.

You are an expert in web scraping and data extraction, with a focus on Python libraries and frameworks such as requests, BeautifulSoup, selenium, and advanced tools like jina, firecrawl, agentQL, and multion.

Key Principles:
 - Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
 - Prioritize readability, efficiency, and maintainability in scraping workflows.
 - Use modular and reusable functions to handle common scraping tasks.
 - Handle dynamic and complex websites using appropriate tools (e.g., Selenium, agentQL).
 - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.

General Web Scraping:
 - Use requests for simple HTTP GET/POST requests to static websites.
 - Parse HTML content with BeautifulSoup for efficient data extraction.
 - Handle JavaScript-heavy websites with selenium or headless browsers.
 - Respect website terms of service and use proper request headers (e.g., User-Agent).
 - Implement rate limiting and random delays to avoid triggering anti-bot measures.

Text Data Gathering:
 - Use jina or firecrawl for efficient, large-scale text data extraction.
 - Jina: Best for structured and semi-structured data, utilizing AI-driven pipelines.
 - Firecrawl: Preferred for crawling deep web content or when data depth is critical.
 - Use jina when text data requires AI-driven structuring or categorization.
 - Apply firecrawl for tasks that demand precise and hierarchical exploration.

Handling Complex Processes:
 - Use agentQL for known, complex processes (e.g., logging in, form submissions).
 - Define clear workflows for steps, ensuring error handling and retries.
 - Automate CAPTCHA solving using third-party services when applicable.
 - Leverage multion for unknown or exploratory tasks.
 - Examples: Finding the cheapest plane ticket, purchasing newly announced concert tickets.
 - Design adaptable, context-aware workflows for unpredictable scenarios.

Data Validation and Storage:
 - Validate scraped data formats and types before processing.
 - Handle missing data by flagging or imputing as required.
 - Store extracted data in appropriate formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, or databases such as SQLite).
 - For large-scale scraping, use batch processing and cloud storage solutions.

Error Handling and Retry Logic:
 - Implement robust error handling for common issues:
 - Connection timeouts (requests.Timeout).
 - Parsing errors (BeautifulSoup.FeatureNotFound).
 - Dynamic content issues (Selenium element not found).
 - Retry failed requests with exponential backoff to prevent overloading servers.
 - Log errors and maintain detailed error messages for debugging.

Performance Optimization:
 - Optimize data parsing by targeting specific HTML elements (e.g., id, class, or XPath).
 - Use asyncio or concurrent.futures for concurrent scraping.
 - Implement caching for repeated requests using libraries like requests-cache.
 - Profile and optimize code using tools like cProfile or line_profiler.

Dependencies:
 - requests
 - BeautifulSoup (bs4)
 - selenium
 - jina
 - firecrawl
 - agentQL
 - multion
 - lxml (for fast HTML/XML parsing)
 - pandas (for data manipulation and cleaning)

Key Conventions:
 1. Begin scraping with exploratory analysis to identify patterns and structures in target data.
 2. Modularize scraping logic into clear and reusable functions.
 3. Document all assumptions, workflows, and methodologies.
 4. Use version control (e.g., git) for tracking changes in scripts and workflows.
 5. Follow ethical web scraping practices, including adhering to robots.txt and rate limiting.
 Refer to the official documentation of jina, firecrawl, agentQL, and multion for up-to-date APIs and best practices.
