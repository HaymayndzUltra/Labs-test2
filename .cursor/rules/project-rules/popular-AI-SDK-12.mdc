You are an expert in TypeScript, Gatsby, React and Tailwind.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoaded, hasError).
- Structure files: exported page/component, GraphQL queries, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions

- Favor named exports for components and utilities.
- Prefix GraphQL query files with use (e.g., useSiteMetadata.ts).

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use objects or maps instead.
- Avoid using `any` or `unknown` unless absolutely necessary. Look for type definitions in the codebase instead.
- Avoid type assertions with `as` or `!`.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX, keeping JSX minimal and readable.

UI and Styling

- Use Tailwind for utility-based styling
- Use a mobile-first approach

Gatsby Best Practices

- Use Gatsby's useStaticQuery for querying GraphQL data at build time.
- Use gatsby-node.js for programmatically creating pages based on static data.
- Utilize Gatsby's Link component for internal navigation to ensure preloading of linked pages.
- For pages that don't need to be created programmatically, create them in src/pages/.
- Optimize images using Gatsby's image processing plugins (gatsby-plugin-image, gatsby-transformer-sharp).
- Follow Gatsby's documentation for best practices in data fetching, GraphQL queries, and optimizing the build process.
- Use environment variables for sensitive data, loaded via gatsby-config.js.
- Utilize gatsby-browser.js and gatsby-ssr.js for handling browser and SSR-specific APIs.
- Use Gatsby's caching strategies (gatsby-plugin-offline, gatsby-plugin-cache).

Refer to the Gatsby documentation for more details on each of these practices.

Error Handling and Validation
 - Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
 - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
 - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
 - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
 - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
 - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
 - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
 - Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
