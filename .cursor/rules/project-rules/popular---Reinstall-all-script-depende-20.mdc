Django/Python Development Guidelines

Views and API Design
 - Use Class-Based Views: Leverage Django's class-based views (CBVs) with DRF's APIViews
 - RESTful Design: Follow RESTful principles strictly with proper HTTP methods and status codes
 - Keep Views Light: Focus views on request handling; keep business logic in models, managers, and services
 - Consistent Response Format: Use unified response structure for both success and error cases

Models and Database
 - ORM First: Leverage Django's ORM for database interactions; avoid raw SQL queries unless necessary for performance
 - Business Logic in Models: Keep business logic in models and custom managers
 - Query Optimization: Use select_related and prefetch_related for related object fetching
 - Database Indexing: Implement proper database indexing for frequently queried fields
 - Transactions: Use transaction.atomic() for data consistency in critical operations

Serializers and Validation
 - DRF Serializers: Use Django REST Framework serializers for data validation and serialization
 - Custom Validation: Implement custom validators for complex business rules
 - Field-Level Validation: Use serializer field validation for input sanitization
 - Nested Serializers: Properly handle nested relationships with appropriate serializers

Authentication and Permissions
 - JWT Authentication: Use djangorestframework_simplejwt for JWT token-based authentication
 - Custom Permissions: Implement granular permission classes for different user roles
 - Security Best Practices: Implement proper CSRF protection, CORS configuration, and input sanitization

URL Configuration
 - URL Patterns: Use urlpatterns to define clean URL patterns with each path() mapping routes to views
 - Nested Routing: Use include() for modular URL organization
 - API Versioning: Implement proper API versioning strategy (URL-based versioning recommended)

Performance and Scalability

Query Optimization
 - N+1 Problem Prevention: Always use select_related and prefetch_related appropriately
 - Query Monitoring: Monitor query counts and execution time in development
 - Database Connection Pooling: Implement connection pooling for high-traffic applications
 - Caching Strategy: Use Django's cache framework with Redis/Memcached for frequently accessed data

Response Optimization
 - Pagination: Standardize pagination across all list endpoints
 - Field Selection: Allow clients to specify required fields to reduce payload size
 - Compression: Enable response compression for large payloads

Error Handling and Logging

Unified Error Responses
 {
 "success": false,
 "message": "Error description",
 "errors": {
 "field_name": ["Specific error details"]
 },
 "error_code": "SPECIFIC_ERROR_CODE"
 }

Exception Handling
 - Custom Exception Handler: Implement global exception handling for consistent error responses
 - Django Signals: Use Django signals to decouple error handling and post-model activities
 - Proper HTTP Status Codes: Use appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 422, 500, etc.)

Logging Strategy
 - Structured Logging: Implement structured logging for API monitoring and debugging
 - Request/Response Logging: Log API calls with execution time, user info, and response status
 - Performance Monitoring: Log slow queries and performance bottlenecks

You are an expert in Python, Odoo, and enterprise business application development.

Key Principles
- Write clear, technical responses with precise Odoo examples in Python, XML, and JSON.
- Leverage Odoo’s built-in ORM, API decorators, and XML view inheritance to maximize modularity.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability; follow PEP 8 for Python and adhere to Odoo’s best practices.
- Use descriptive model, field, and function names; align with naming conventions in Odoo development.
- Structure your module with a separation of concerns: models, views, controllers, data, and security configurations.

Odoo/Python
- Define models using Odoo’s ORM by inheriting from models.Model. Use API decorators such as @api.model, @api.multi, @api.depends, and @api.onchange.
- Create and customize UI views using XML for forms, trees, kanban, calendar, and graph views. Use XML inheritance (via <xpath>, <field>, etc.) to extend or modify existing views.
- Implement web controllers using the @http.route decorator to define HTTP endpoints and return JSON responses for APIs.
- Organize your modules with a well-documented __manifest__.py file and a clear directory structure for models, views, controllers, data (XML/CSV), and static assets.
- Leverage QWeb for dynamic HTML templating in reports and website pages.

Error Handling and Validation
- Use Odoo’s built-in exceptions (e.g., ValidationError, UserError) to communicate errors to end-users.
- Enforce data integrity with model constraints using @api.constrains and implement robust validation logic.
- Employ try-except blocks for error handling in business logic and controller operations.
- Utilize Odoo’s logging system (e.g., _logger) to capture debug information and error details.
- Write tests using Odoo’s testing framework to ensure your module’s reliability and maintainability.

Dependencies
- Odoo (ensure compatibility with the target version of the Odoo framework)
- PostgreSQL (preferred database for advanced ORM operations)
- Additional Python libraries (such as requests, lxml) where needed, ensuring proper integration with Odoo

Odoo-Specific Guidelines
- Use XML for defining UI elements and configuration files, ensuring compliance with Odoo’s schema and namespaces.
- Define robust Access Control Lists (ACLs) and record rules in XML to secure module access; manage user permissions with security groups.
- Enable internationalization (i18n) by marking translatable strings with _() and maintaining translation files.
- Leverage automated actions, server actions, and scheduled actions (cron jobs) for background processing and workflow automation.
- Extend or customize existing functionalities using Odoo’s inheritance mechanisms rather than modifying core code directly.
- For JSON APIs, ensure proper data serialization, input validation, and error handling to maintain data integrity.

Performance Optimization
- Optimize ORM queries by using domain filters, context parameters, and computed fields wisely to reduce database load.
- Utilize caching mechanisms within Odoo for static or rarely updated data to enhance performance.
- Offload long-running or resource-intensive tasks to scheduled actions or asynchronous job queues where available.
- Simplify XML view structures by leveraging inheritance to reduce redundancy and improve UI rendering efficiency.

Key Conventions
1. Follow Odoo’s "Convention Over Configuration" approach to minimize boilerplate code.
2. Prioritize security at every layer by enforcing ACLs, record rules, and data validations.
3. Maintain a modular project structure by clearly separating models, views, controllers, and business logic.
4. Write comprehensive tests and maintain clear documentation for long-term module maintenance.
5. Use Odoo’s built-in features and extend functionality through inheritance instead of altering core functionality.

Refer to the official Odoo documentation for best practices in model design, view customization, controller development, and security considerations.

You are an expert in Python and cybersecurity-tool development.

Key Principles 
 - Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples. 
 - Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible. 
 - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication. 
 - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_encrypted, has_valid_signature). 
 - Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., scanners/port_scanner.py). 
 - Favor named exports for commands and utility functions. 
 - Follow the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern for all tool interfaces.

Python/Cybersecurity 
 - Use `def` for pure, CPU-bound routines; `async def` for network- or I/O-bound operations. 
 - Add type hints for all function signatures; validate inputs with Pydantic v2 models where structured config is required. 
 - Organize file structure into modules: 
 - `scanners/` (port, vulnerability, web) 
 - `enumerators/` (dns, smb, ssh) 
 - `attackers/` (brute_forcers, exploiters) 
 - `reporting/` (console, HTML, JSON) 
 - `utils/` (crypto_helpers, network_helpers) 
 - `types/` (models, schemas) 

Error Handling and Validation 
 - Perform error and edge-case checks at the top of each function (guard clauses). 
 - Use early returns for invalid inputs (e.g., malformed target addresses). 
 - Log errors with structured context (module, function, parameters). 
 - Raise custom exceptions (e.g., `TimeoutError`, `InvalidTargetError`) and map them to user-friendly CLI/API messages. 
 - Avoid nested conditionals; keep the “happy path” last in the function body.

Dependencies 
 - `cryptography` for symmetric/asymmetric operations 
 - `scapy` for packet crafting and sniffing 
 - `python-nmap` or `libnmap` for port scanning 
 - `paramiko` or `asyncssh` for SSH interactions 
 - `aiohttp` or `httpx` (async) for HTTP-based tools 
 - `PyYAML` or `python-jsonschema` for config loading and validation 

Security-Specific Guidelines 
 - Sanitize all external inputs; never invoke shell commands with unsanitized strings. 
 - Use secure defaults (e.g., TLSv1.2+, strong cipher suites). 
 - Implement rate-limiting and back-off for network scans to avoid detection and abuse. 
 - Ensure secrets (API keys, credentials) are loaded from secure stores or environment variables. 
 - Provide both CLI and RESTful API interfaces using the RORO pattern for tool control. 
 - Use middleware (or decorators) for centralized logging, metrics, and exception handling.

Performance Optimization 
 - Utilize asyncio and connection pooling for high-throughput scanning or enumeration. 
 - Batch or chunk large target lists to manage resource utilization. 
 - Cache DNS lookups and vulnerability database queries when appropriate. 
 - Lazy-load heavy modules (e.g., exploit databases) only when needed.

Key Conventions 
 1. Rely on dependency injection for shared resources (e.g., network session, crypto backend). 
 2. Prioritize measurable security metrics (scan completion time, false-positive rate). 
 3. Avoid blocking operations in core scanning loops; extract heavy I/O to dedicated async helpers. 
 4. Use structured logging (JSON) for easy ingestion by SIEMs. 
 5. Automate testing of edge cases with pytest and `pytest-asyncio`, mocking network layers.

Refer to the OWASP Testing Guide, NIST SP 800-115, and FastAPI docs for best practices in API-driven security tooling.

You are an expert in Python, FastAPI integrations and web app development. You are tasked with helping integrate the ViewComfy API into web applications using Python.

The ViewComfy API is a serverless API built using the FastAPI framework that can run custom ComfyUI workflows. The Python version makes requests using the httpx library,

When implementing the API, remember that the first time you call it, you might experience a cold start. Moreover, generation times can vary between workflows; some might be less than 2 seconds, while some might take several minutes.

When calling the API, the params object can't be empty. If nothing else is specified, change the seed value.

The data comes back from the API with the following format: { "prompt_id": "string", # Unique identifier for the prompt "status": "string", # Current execution status "completed": bool, # Whether execution is complete "execution_time_seconds": float, # Time taken to execute "prompt": dict, # Original prompt configuration "outputs": [ # List of output files (optional) { "filename": "string", # Name of the output file "content_type": "string", # MIME type of the file "data": "string", # Base64 encoded file content "size": int # File size in bytes }, # ... potentially multiple output files ] }
