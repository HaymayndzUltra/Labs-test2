**Key Principles**
 - Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
 - Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.
 - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
 - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
 - Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., tasks/data_processing.py).
 - Favor named exports for utility functions and task definitions.
 - Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.

**Python/RoboCorp**
 - Use `def` for pure functions and `async def` for asynchronous operations.
 - Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.
 - File structure: exported tasks, sub-tasks, utilities, static content, types (models, schemas).
 - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
 - For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
 - Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., `if condition: execute_task()`).

**Error Handling and Validation**
 - Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
 - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
 - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested `if` statements.
 - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
 - Avoid unnecessary `else` statements; use the `if-return` pattern instead.
 - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
 - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
 - Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.

**Dependencies**
 - RoboCorp
 - RPA Framework

**RoboCorp-Specific Guidelines**
 - Use functional components (plain functions) and Pydantic models for input validation and response schemas.
 - Use declarative task definitions with clear return type annotations.
 - Use `def` for synchronous operations and `async def` for asynchronous ones.
 - Minimize lifecycle event handlers; prefer context managers for managing setup and teardown processes.
 - Use middleware for logging, error monitoring, and performance optimization.
 - Optimize for performance using async functions for I/O-bound tasks, caching strategies, and lazy loading.
 - Use specific exceptions like `RPA.HTTP.HTTPException` for expected errors and model them as specific responses.
 - Use middleware for handling unexpected errors, logging, and error monitoring.
 - Use Pydantic's `BaseModel` for consistent input/output validation and response schemas.

**Performance Optimization**
 - Minimize blocking I/O operations; use asynchronous operations for all database calls and external API requests.
 - Implement caching for static and frequently accessed data using tools like Redis or in-memory stores.
 - Optimize data serialization and deserialization with Pydantic.
 - Use lazy loading techniques for large datasets and substantial process responses.

**Key Conventions**
 1. Rely on RoboCorp’s dependency injection system for managing state and shared resources.
 2. Prioritize RPA performance metrics (execution time, resource utilization, throughput).
 3. Limit blocking operations in tasks:
 - Favor asynchronous and non-blocking flows.
 - Use dedicated async functions for database and external API operations.
 - Structure tasks and dependencies clearly to optimize readability and maintainability.

Refer to RoboCorp and RPA Framework documentation for Data Models, Task Definitions, and Middleware best practices.

# Package Management with `uv`

These rules define strict guidelines for managing Python dependencies in this project using the `uv` dependency manager.

**✅ Use `uv` exclusively**

- All Python dependencies **must be installed, synchronized, and locked** using `uv`.
- Never use `pip`, `pip-tools`, or `poetry` directly for dependency management.

**🔁 Managing Dependencies**

Always use these commands:

```bash
# Add or upgrade dependencies
uv add <package>

# Remove dependencies
uv remove <package>

# Reinstall all dependencies from lock file
uv sync
```

**🔁 Scripts**

```bash
# Run script with proper dependencies
uv run script.py
```

You can edit inline-metadata manually:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# dependencies = [
# "torch",
# "torchvision",
# "opencv-python",
# "numpy",
# "matplotlib",
# "Pillow",
