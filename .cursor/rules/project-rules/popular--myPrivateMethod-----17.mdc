### Media Queries
* Default to mobile first (`min-width` queries).
* Use `screen` for all media queries.

### Nesting
* Do not use `&` operator.
* Never nest beyond first level.
* Exceptions:
 * Media queries should be nested.
 * Parent-child relationships with multiple states/modifiers affecting children.
* Keep nesting simple and logical.

## JavaScript

### General Principles
* Lean towards using zero external dependencies.
* Use JS when needed, but reach for native browser features first.
 * e.g., use "popover" or "details" over JS unless there is a good reason to do otherwise.
* Do not use "var".
* Prefer "const" over "let" - avoid mutation unless necessary.
* Prefer "for (const thing of things)" over "things.forEach()".
* Put new lines before new "blocks" of code. A block is anything with a "{" and "}".

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize **image loading** by using Shopify's CDN and the `image_url` filter.
- Minify **JavaScript and CSS files**.
- Leverage **browser caching**.
- Reduce the number of **HTTP requests**.
- Consider **lazy loading**.
- Monitor **theme performance** using Google Lighthouse and Shopify Theme Check.

### File Structure
* Group scripts by feature area where appropriate.
 * e.g., "collection.js" contains multiple classes related to the collection page; they don't each need to be their own file if they are all being used together consistently.

### Modules
* Use the module pattern for loading JavaScript. This avoids polluting the global scope and allows for easier code splitting.

#### Privacy and Instance Methods
* The public API of a module should be the smallest possible surface to provide the necessary functionality.
* All other instance methods should be prefixed with "#" and are private.
* Do not use instance methods for functions that do not use the class instance.

```javascript
class MyClass {
 constructor() {
 this.cache = new Map();
 }

// This is a method that is meant to be used by other classes that import this module
 myPublicMethod() {
 this.#myPrivateMethod();
 }

// This is a method that is only meant to be used within this module and requires access to the instance
 #myPrivateMethod() {
 this.cache.set('key', 'value');
 }
}

// This is a utility that is scoped to this module. It does not require access to the instance to work
const someUtilityFunction = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;
```

 - Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).
 - Favor named exports for routes and utility functions.
 - Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.

Python/FastAPI
 - Use def for pure functions and async def for asynchronous operations.
 - Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.
 - File structure: exported router, sub-routes, utilities, static content, types (models, schemas).
 - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
 - For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
 - Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if condition: do_something()).

Error Handling and Validation
 - Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
 - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
 - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
 - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
 - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.

You are a Python programming assistant. You will be given
a function implementation and a series of unit test results.
Your goal is to write a few sentences to explain why your
implementation is wrong, as indicated by the tests. You
will need this as guidance when you try again later. Only
provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the
implementation. You will be given a few examples by the
user.

Example 1:
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
 """
 Given integers a and b,
 return the total value of a and b.
 """
 return a - b

[unit test results from previous impl]:
Tested passed:
Tests failed:
assert add(1, 2) == 3 # output: -1
assert add(1, 2) == 4 # output: -1

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test cases where the input
integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does
not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the
second integer from the first. To fix this issue, we should
change the operator from '-' to '+' in the return statement.
This will ensure that the function returns the correct output
for the given input.
