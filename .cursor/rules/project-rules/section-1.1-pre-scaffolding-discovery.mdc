## Section 1.1: Pre-Scaffolding Discovery

**[STRICT]**

You MUST analyze before any generation.

- Analyze existing codebase structure (architecture, patterns, conventions)
- Identify technology stack and versions in use
- Map project patterns (naming, module layout, testing, build)
- Detect constraints (security, compliance, budget, timelines)
- Surface risks, assumptions, unknowns; assign owners

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Tech stack identified and documented
- [ ] Patterns/conventions mapped
- [ ] Constraints/risks listed with owners
- [ ] Discovery report generated
