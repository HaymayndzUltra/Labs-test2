### Objective
 - Create a Next.js solution that is not only functional but also adheres to the best practices in performance, security, and maintainability.

### Code Style and Structure
 - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
 - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
 - Favor iteration and modularization over code duplication.
 - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
 - Structure files with exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.
 - Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).

### Optimization and Best Practices
 - Minimize the use of `'use client'`, `useEffect`, and `setState`; favor React Server Components (RSC) and Next.js SSR features.
 - Implement dynamic imports for code splitting and optimization.
 - Use responsive design with a mobile-first approach.
 - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

### Error Handling and Validation
 - Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
 - Use early returns for error conditions.
 - Implement guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
 - Use custom error types for consistent error handling.

### UI and Styling
 - Use modern UI frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI) for styling.
 - Implement consistent design and responsive patterns across platforms.

### State Management and Data Fetching
 - Use modern state management solutions (e.g., Zustand, TanStack React Query) to handle global state and data fetching.
 - Implement validation using Zod for schema validation.

### Security and Performance
 - Implement proper error handling, user input validation, and secure coding practices.
 - Follow performance optimization techniques, such as reducing load times and improving rendering efficiency.

### Testing and Documentation
 - Write unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.
 - Provide clear and concise comments for complex logic.
 - Use JSDoc comments for functions and components to improve IDE intellisense.

### Methodology
 1. **System 2 Thinking**: Approach the problem with analytical rigor. Break down the requirements into smaller, manageable parts and thoroughly consider each step before implementation.
 2. **Tree of Thoughts**: Evaluate multiple possible solutions and their consequences. Use a structured approach to explore different paths and select the optimal one.
 3. **Iterative Refinement**: Before finalizing the code, consider improvements, edge cases, and optimizations. Iterate through potential enhancements to ensure the final solution is robust.

**Process**:
 1. **Deep Dive Analysis**: Begin by conducting a thorough analysis of the task at hand, considering the technical requirements and constraints.
 2. **Planning**: Develop a clear plan that outlines the architectural structure and flow of the solution, using <PLANNING> tags if necessary.
 3. **Implementation**: Implement the solution step-by-step, ensuring that each part adheres to the specified best practices.
 4. **Review and Optimize**: Perform a review of the code, looking for areas of potential optimization and improvement.
 5. **Finalization**: Finalize the code by ensuring it meets all requirements, is secure, and is performant.

You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Vite, Vue.js, Vue Router, Pinia, VueUse, Headless UI, Element Plus, and Tailwind, with a deep understanding of best practices and performance optimization techniques in these technologies.

Code Style and Structure
 - Write concise, maintainable, and technically accurate TypeScript code with relevant examples.
 - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
 - Favor iteration and modularization to adhere to DRY principles and avoid code duplication.
 - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
 - Organize files systematically: each file should contain only related content, such as exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.

Naming Conventions
 - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
 - Favor named exports for functions.

TypeScript Usage
 - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types for their extendability and ability to merge.
 - Avoid enums; use maps instead for better type safety and flexibility.
 - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting
 - Use the "function" keyword for pure functions to benefit from hoisting and clarity.
 - Always use the Vue Composition API script setup style.

UI and Styling
 - Use Headless UI, Element Plus, and Tailwind for components and styling.
 - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization
 - Leverage VueUse functions where applicable to enhance reactivity and performance.
 - Wrap asynchronous components in Suspense with a fallback UI.
 - Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
 - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
 - Implement an optimized chunking strategy during the Vite build process, such as code splitting, to generate smaller bundle sizes.

Key Conventions
 - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID) using tools like Lighthouse or WebPageTest.
