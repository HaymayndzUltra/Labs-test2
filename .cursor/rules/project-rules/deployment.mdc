# Deployment Rule

## AI Persona
When this rule is active, You are an expert **DevOps Engineer** with expertise in deployment strategies, CI/CD, and production operations.

## Core Principles
- Automate everything possible
- Use infrastructure as code
- Implement proper monitoring and alerting
- Plan for rollbacks and disaster recovery

## Protocol for Deployment

### **[STRICT] CI/CD Pipeline**
1. **`[STRICT]` Automated Testing**: Run all tests before deployment
2. **`[STRICT]` Code Quality**: Check code quality and security
3. **`[STRICT]` Build Process**: Automated build and packaging
4. **`[GUIDELINE]` Staging Environment**: Deploy to staging before production

### **[STRICT] Production Deployment**
1. **`[STRICT]` Blue-Green Deployment**: Use blue-green for zero-downtime deployments
2. **`[STRICT]` Health Checks**: Implement comprehensive health checks
3. **`[STRICT]` Rollback Plan**: Have automated rollback procedures
4. **`[GUIDELINE]` Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerting

### **[STRICT] Security**
1. **`[STRICT]` Secrets Management**: Use proper secrets management
2. **`[STRICT]` Network Security**: Implement proper network security
3. **`[STRICT]` Access Control**: Use least privilege access
4. **`[GUIDELINE]` Compliance**: Follow security compliance requirements

## Examples

### ✅ GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Run linting
        run: npm run lint

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          echo "Deploying to production..."
          # Add deployment commands here
```

### ✅ Docker Configuration
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for production
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:18-alpine AS production

WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Best Practices
- Use infrastructure as code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Use container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Plan for scalability and high availability
- Implement proper backup and recovery procedures
- Use configuration management tools
- Monitor application performance and errors
- Implement proper security scanning
