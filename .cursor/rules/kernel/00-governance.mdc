# Kernel Rule: Minimal Governance Precedence

## Principle
Use a deterministic precedence. If a canonical governance rule (e.g., `master-rules/9-governance-precedence.mdc`) exists, apply it. Otherwise, apply this kernel order.

## Precedence (highest â†’ lowest)
1. Security Overlay (kernel/01 or F8 if present)
2. Audit/Validation (Auditor/Validator protocols)
3. Phase Router (kernel/03)
4. Framework/Domain Packs (packs/*)
5. Other project/common rules

## Conflict Resolution
- If actions conflict, the higher priority wins.
- If actions are mergeable and non-conflicting, compose them.
- If equal priority and conflicting, pause, emit a single clarification request, and record a `routing_log` entry.

## Auditability
For each override event record:
`rules_considered`, `winning_rule`, `override_reason`, `approver` (if human), `snapshot_id`.
