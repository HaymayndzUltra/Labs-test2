# Kernel Rule: Observability & Audit

## Logging Requirements
- Structured (JSON) logs; include correlation/request IDs.
- Redact PHI/PII; never log secrets or tokens.
- Record security events (authn/authz changes, data access) with minimal necessary context.

## Telemetry
- Define key SLIs (latency, error rate) and SLOs; emit metrics.
- Sampling policies for high-volume logs.
