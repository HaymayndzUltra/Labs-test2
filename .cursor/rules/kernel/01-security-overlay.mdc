# Kernel Rule: Security & Compliance Overlay

## Protocol
1. [STRICT] No plaintext secrets or credentials in code/config. Use secret managers or env-injection.
2. [STRICT] Block merges on critical SCA/SAST findings until remediated or explicitly waived with evidence.
3. [STRICT] Generate SBOM on release and store alongside build artifacts.
4. [STRICT] Validate and sanitize all external inputs; set content-type and body size limits.
5. [STRICT] Enforce authenticated routes by default; apply least privilege RBAC/ABAC; log security-relevant events without secrets.
6. [STRICT] TLS in transit; encrypt sensitive data at rest with platform-native KMS where applicable.

## HIPAA Hooks (activate when `hipaa` pack is loaded)
- Idle session timeout: 15 minutes
- PHI encryption (AES-256 at rest), TLS 1.2+ in transit
- Audit access to PHI (who/what/when), immutable logs with retention policy
- No PHI in logs; masking in UI and telemetry

## Communication
- `[SECURITY CHECK] secrets, deps, authz, privacy, audit enforced.`
