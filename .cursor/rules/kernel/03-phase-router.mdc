# Kernel Rule: Phase Router (Autonomous)

## Phases & Artifacts
- BR (Brief/Discovery): detect stacks; load packs; emit `PLAN.md` with lanes and conflicts.
- AP (Approve/Freeze): freeze plan; emit go-signal.
- LA (Backend): scaffold/contracts/authz/audit; stop if migrations/security waiver needed.
- LB (Frontend): shell/auth flows/guards/a11y-perf; stop if brand/compliance inputs missing.
- LC (Compliance): HIPAA hooks; stop if PHI data map absent.
- QA (Gates): tests â‰¥80%, lints, SCA/SAST, SBOM; block on criticals.
- PR (Evidence): PR description + evidence bundle.

## Transitions
- Auto-continue if no stop condition; otherwise emit a single clarification and pause.
