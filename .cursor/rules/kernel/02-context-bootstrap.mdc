# Kernel Rule: Context Bootstrap

## Discovery
1. Search `.cursor/rules/**` for `.mdc` files only; ignore `.md` for rule loading.
2. Identify concerned files; from each directory ascend to root and load nearest `README.md` files.
3. Deduplicate rule files and READMEs.

## Application
- First visible action: announce loaded rules succinctly.
- Prefer targeted loading (relevant packs) rather than exhaustive.
- Re-read a README only if content likely changed.
