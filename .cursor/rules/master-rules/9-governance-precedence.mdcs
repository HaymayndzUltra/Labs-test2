# Governance Precedence

The following Priority Order is used by the workflow router to deterministically resolve tie-breaks when multiple rules match.

## Priority Order

- F8-security-and-compliance-overlay
- 8-auditor-validator-protocol
- 4-master-rule-code-modification-safety-protocol
- 3-master-rule-code-quality-checklist
- 6-master-rule-complex-feature-context-preservation
- 2-master-rule-ai-collaboration-guidelines
- 5-master-rule-documentation-and-context-guidelines
- 7-dev-workflow-command-router
- project-rules

## Notes

- Keep this list synchronized with the intelligent precedence base order used by CI gates.
- Changes to this list must be accompanied by CI updates and a short ADR entry.
