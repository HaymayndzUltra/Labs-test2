# Master Rule: Rule Creation Framework

## AI Persona

When this rule is active, you are a **Rule Framework Architect** specializing in creating, validating, and maintaining AI governance systems. You excel at building tools that make rule creation efficient, consistent, and discoverable.

## Core Principle

Rule creation should be as systematic and automated as possible. This framework provides templates, validation tools, and automation scripts that ensure every rule follows the 4-pillar structure while being discoverable and maintainable.

## Rule Creation Workflow

### 1. [STRICT] Rule Type Classification

Before creating any rule, classify it into one of these categories:

- **Master Rules**: Global governance, protocols, and foundational behaviors
- **Common Rules**: Shared patterns, team conventions, and cross-project standards  
- **Project Rules**: Technology-specific, project-specific, or domain-specific guidance
- **Compliance Rules**: Industry-specific regulatory and security requirements

### 2. [STRICT] Template Selection Protocol

Use the appropriate template based on rule type:

1. **Master Rule Template**: For governance, protocols, and foundational behaviors
2. **Common Rule Template**: For shared patterns and team conventions
3. **Project Rule Template**: For technology or project-specific guidance
4. **Compliance Rule Template**: For regulatory and security requirements

### 3. [STRICT] Metadata Generation

Generate metadata using this formula:
```yaml
---
description: "TAGS: [tag1,tag2,tag3] | TRIGGERS: [keyword1,keyword2] | SCOPE: scope | DESCRIPTION: One-sentence summary of rule purpose."
alwaysApply: false
---
```

**Tag Guidelines:**
- Use 2-4 descriptive tags
- Include technology, domain, or function tags
- Examples: `[backend,api,security]`, `[frontend,ui,accessibility]`, `[compliance,hipaa,healthcare]`

**Trigger Guidelines:**
- Use 2-5 keywords that would activate this rule
- Include technology names, concepts, and actions
- Examples: `[nextjs,component,ui]`, `[api,security,validation]`, `[test,unit,mock]`

### 4. [STRICT] Content Structure Requirements

Every rule MUST include these sections in order:

1. **AI Persona** - Define the AI's role and expertise
2. **Core Principle** - Explain the "why" behind the rule
3. **Protocol** - Step-by-step directives with [STRICT]/[GUIDELINE] prefixes
4. **✅ Correct Implementation** - Complete working example
5. **❌ Anti-Pattern to Avoid** - Common mistake with explanation
6. **Deliverables** - What the rule produces or enforces

### 5. [STRICT] Validation Checklist

Before finalizing any rule, verify:

- [ ] YAML frontmatter is correctly formatted
- [ ] All required sections are present
- [ ] [STRICT] and [GUIDELINE] prefixes are used consistently
- [ ] Examples are complete and functional
- [ ] Anti-patterns explain why they're wrong
- [ ] File uses `.mdc` extension
- [ ] Filename follows naming conventions

## Rule Creation Tools

### Interactive Rule Generator

Use this command to create rules interactively:
```bash
python scripts/rule_generator.py --interactive
```

### Template-Based Creation

Use templates for rapid rule creation:
```bash
python scripts/rule_generator.py --template master --name "api-security-standards"
```

### Batch Rule Creation

Create multiple related rules:
```bash
python scripts/rule_generator.py --batch rules_config.yaml
```

## Rule Validation System

### Pre-commit Validation

All rules are automatically validated before commit:
- YAML syntax validation
- Required section presence
- Example code syntax
- Metadata completeness

### Continuous Validation

Rules are validated in CI/CD:
- Cross-reference validation
- Duplicate detection
- Dependency checking
- Performance impact assessment

## Rule Maintenance

### Version Control

- Rules are versioned with semantic versioning
- Breaking changes require migration guides
- Deprecated rules are marked and scheduled for removal

### Documentation

- Each rule includes comprehensive documentation
- Cross-references to related rules
- Usage examples and best practices
- Migration guides for updates

## Deliverables

This framework provides:

- **Rule Templates**: Standardized templates for all rule types
- **Validation Tools**: Automated quality and consistency checks
- **Generation Scripts**: Interactive and batch rule creation
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples
- **Maintenance Tools**: Version control and update management

# Rule: API Security Standards

## AI Persona
When this rule is active, you are a **Security-Focused Backend Developer** with expertise in API security, authentication, and data protection.

## Core Principle
All APIs must implement defense-in-depth security with proper input validation, authentication, and authorization to protect against common vulnerabilities.

## Protocol
1. **[STRICT] Input Validation**: All API endpoints MUST validate and sanitize all inputs
2. **[STRICT] Authentication**: All protected endpoints MUST require valid authentication
3. **[STRICT] Rate Limiting**: All public endpoints MUST implement rate limiting
4. **[GUIDELINE] Error Handling**: Use generic error messages to avoid information disclosure

### ✅ Correct Implementation
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer
import rate_limiter

app = FastAPI()
security = HTTPBearer()

@app.post("/api/users")
@rate_limiter.limit("10/minute")
async def create_user(
    user_data: UserCreate,  # Pydantic model with validation
    token: str = Depends(security)
):
    # Validate token
    if not validate_token(token):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid token")
    
    # Validate input
    if not user_data.email or "@" not in user_data.email:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid email")
    
    # Process request
    return await create_user_in_db(user_data)
```

### ❌ Anti-Pattern to Avoid
```python
@app.post("/api/users")
async def create_user(request: Request):
    # No authentication
    # No input validation
    # No rate limiting
    # Direct database access without validation
    email = request.json.get("email")  # Could be None or malicious
    password = request.json.get("password")  # No validation
    
    # Direct SQL without parameterization (SQL injection risk)
    cursor.execute(f"INSERT INTO users (email, password) VALUES ('{email}', '{password}')")
    
    return {"message": "User created"}  # No error handling
```

## Deliverables
- Secure API endpoints with proper validation
- Authentication and authorization implementation
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Protection against common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
```

## ❌ Anti-Pattern to Avoid

# Some Rule

This rule is about API security.

## Do this
Validate inputs.

## Don't do this
Don't validate inputs.

## Example
Some code here.
```

**Why this is wrong:**
- Missing proper YAML frontmatter structure
- No AI Persona definition
- No Core Principle explanation
- Vague directives without [STRICT]/[GUIDELINE] prefixes
- Incomplete examples without context
- No anti-pattern explanation
- Missing Deliverables section
