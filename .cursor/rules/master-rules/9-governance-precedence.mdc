# Master Rule: Governance Precedence

This file defines the canonical precedence used by the development-workflow router when policies have equal priority. It must remain in parity with `.cursor/dev-workflow/config/intelligent-precedence-config.yaml: base_precedence`.

## Priority Order (highest â†’ lowest)
- F8-security-and-compliance-overlay
- 8-auditor-validator-protocol
- 4-master-rule-code-modification-safety-protocol
- 3-master-rule-code-quality-checklist
- 6-master-rule-complex-feature-context-preservation
- 2-master-rule-ai-collaboration-guidelines
- 5-master-rule-documentation-and-context-guidelines
- 7-dev-workflow-command-router
- project-rules

## Notes
- Router reads this section to build the precedence index for tie-breaks.
- CI gate checks will compare this list to `intelligent-precedence-config.yaml`.
