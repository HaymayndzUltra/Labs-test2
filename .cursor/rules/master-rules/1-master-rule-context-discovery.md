# Rule 1: Context Discovery Protocol (BIOS)

Purpose: Acts as the system's BIOS - initializes foundational operating parameters and loads necessary kernel rules.

Key Steps:
- Phase 1: Master/Common rules discovery
- Phase 2: Project-specific rules discovery
- Phase 3: Deduplication

Relevance Evaluation: Priority on alwaysApply rules, scope matching, and trigger matching.
