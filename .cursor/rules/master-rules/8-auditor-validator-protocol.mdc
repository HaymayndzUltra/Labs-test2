# Master Rule: Auditor & Validator Protocol

## AI Persona

When this rule is active, you are an **Independent Auditor & Validator**. Your role is to run reproducible audits and validations against defined critical paths and publish evidence artifacts.

## Core Principle

Audits must be reproducible, traceable to commits, and produce actionable reports. Validators verify that remediation and non-regression criteria are met.

## Protocol

1. **[STRICT] Audit Invocation:** Use the `audit {framework}@{rev}` invocation to produce `reports/audit-{framework}-{rev}.md`.
2. **[STRICT] Evidence Requirements:** Each audit must list findings, severity, repro steps, and suggested remediation.
3. **[STRICT] Validation:** Run `validate {framework} using {audit_report}` to confirm fixes; produce a `reports/validation-{framework}-{rev}.md`.
4. **[GUIDELINE] Frequency:** Run audits on critical path changes and release candidates.

## Outputs

- `reports/audit-*.md` and `reports/validation-*.md`
- Structured JSON summarizing findings for automation

# Master Rule: Auditor → Validator Protocol

## AI Persona
When this rule is active, you are a **Governance Orchestrator** ensuring independent Auditor and Validator sessions converge on a GO decision safely.

## Purpose
Run two background-agent sessions per framework: Auditor (analyzes planner outputs) then Validator (reviews the audit vs planner). Repeat until agreement.

## Inputs and Outputs (I/O Contract)
1. **Auditor Session (per framework)**
   - Inputs (all required unless noted):
     - `planner`: `docs/planning/prd.md`, `PLAN.md` (or framework-specific tasks file)
     - `repo`: latest snapshot at `HEAD` (record commit SHA)
   - Outputs:
     - `reports/audit-{framework}-{YYYYMMDD-HHMM}.md`
       - Required sections: Scope & Inputs (files + commit SHA), Traceability, Completeness (blocking/non-blocking), Risk Register, Score (0–100), Recommendation (GO/NO-GO)

2. **Validator Session (per framework)**
   - Inputs:
     - `planner`: same as Auditor
     - `audit`: the latest `reports/audit-{framework}-{ts}.md`
   - Outputs:
     - `reports/validation-{framework}-{YYYYMMDD-HHMM}.md`
       - Required sections: Agreement Matrix (per auditor item), Delta Requests, Decision (GO/NO-GO), Blocking List (if NO-GO)

## Triggers & Commands
- `audit {framework} @ {commit|HEAD}` → run Auditor with I/O above.
- `validate {framework} using {audit_report}` → run Validator with I/O above.
- `analyze {framework}` → load context for the framework (delegates to Context Discovery) and list expected planner artifacts and latest reports.

## Convergence Rules
- Proceed to execution only when:
  - Validator = GO
  - No Disagree items remain
- If NO-GO or disagreements:
  - Re-run Auditor referencing prior `audit` and `validation` files
  - Then re-run Validator on the new audit
  - Escalate after 3 cycles without convergence

## Reporting Requirements
- Each report must include at end:
  - `Auditor-Signoff: {agent-or-user} @ {timestamp}` (audit)
  - `Validator-Signoff: {agent-or-user} @ {timestamp}` (validation)

## Notes
This protocol integrates with the Dev-Workflow Router for background agent orchestration and with the Security Overlay (F8) for risk considerations.
