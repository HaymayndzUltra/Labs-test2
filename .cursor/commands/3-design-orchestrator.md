   - **Action 1:** Create low-fidelity wireframes for all MVP user flows.
   - **Action 2:** Develop interactive prototypes for key user journeys.
   - **Action 3:** Refine designs to high-fidelity mockups with visual details.
   - **Action 4:** Validate flows with stakeholder feedback and iterate.
   - **Communication:** Present wireframes and prototypes for design review.
   - **Halt:** Await wireframe approval before proceeding.

### STEP 2: Tokens & Component Inventory

1. **`[MUST]` Announce the Goal:**
   > "I will now establish design tokens and create a comprehensive component inventory for consistent UI implementation."

2. **`[MUST]` tokens.json; reusable components; responsive rules:**
   - **Action 1:** Create design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, etc.) in tokens.json.
   - **Action 2:** Build inventory of reusable UI components.
   - **Action 3:** Define responsive design rules and breakpoints.
   - **Action 4:** Document component usage guidelines and variations.
   - **Communication:** Present design system and component inventory for review.
   - **Halt:** Await design system approval before proceeding.

### STEP 3: Accessibility Spec

1. **`[MUST]` Announce the Goal:**
   > "I will now establish comprehensive accessibility specifications to ensure inclusive design."

2. **`[MUST]` Roles/labels/contrast; keyboard; motion constraints:**
   - **Action 1:** Define ARIA roles and labels for all interactive elements.
   - **Action 2:** Establish color contrast ratios and accessibility standards.
   - **Action 3:** Create keyboard navigation specifications.
   - **Action 4:** Define motion constraints and reduced motion preferences.
   - **Communication:** Present accessibility specifications for compliance review.
   - **Halt:** Await accessibility approval before proceeding.

### STEP 4: Design Checkpoint

1. **`[MUST]` Announce the Goal:**
   > "I will now prepare the complete design package for final stakeholder sign-off."

2. **`[MUST]` Stakeholder sign-off on MVP screens:**
   - **Action 1:** Assemble complete design package with all components.
   - **Action 2:** Create design handoff documentation for development.
   - **Action 3:** Prepare design review presentation for stakeholders.
   - **Action 4:** Address any feedback and incorporate final changes.
   - **Communication:** "Design package ready for final sign-off. Please review all MVP screens and approve before proceeding to development."
   - **Halt:** Wait for stakeholder sign-off before proceeding to next phase.
