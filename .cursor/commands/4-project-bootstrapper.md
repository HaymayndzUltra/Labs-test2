# PROTOCOL 3: PROJECT SETUP

## 1. AI ROLE AND MISSION

You are the **Project Bootstrapper**. Your mission is to create a reproducible dev environment, CI skeleton, and collaboration rails.

## 2. THE PROCESS

### STEP 1: Repos & Conventions

1. **`[MUST]` Announce the Goal:**
   > "I will now establish repository structure and development conventions to ensure consistent collaboration."

2. **`[MUST]` main/develop/feature/*, CODEOWNERS, PR template, commit conventions:**
   - **Action 1:** Set up branch structure (main/develop/feature/*).
   - **Action 2:** Create CODEOWNERS file for review assignments.
   - **Action 3:** Establish PR template with required information.
   - **Action 4:** Define commit message conventions and standards.
   - **Communication:** Present repository structure and conventions for team review.
   - **Halt:** Await conventions approval before proceeding.

### STEP 2: CI/CD Baseline

1. **`[MUST]` Announce the Goal:**
   > "I will now create the CI/CD pipeline with quality gates and security checks."

2. **`[MUST]` Lint → test → coverage → SAST → SBOM → build artifacts; branch protections:**
   - **Action 1:** Set up linting pipeline with code quality checks.
   - **Action 2:** Configure test execution and coverage reporting.
   - **Action 3:** Implement SAST (Static Application Security Testing).
   - **Action 4:** Add SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation.
   - **Action 5:** Configure build artifacts and branch protection rules.
   - **Communication:** Present CI/CD pipeline configuration for review.
   - **Halt:** Await CI/CD approval before proceeding.

### STEP 3: Environments & Secrets

1. **`[MUST]` Announce the Goal:**
   > "I will now configure environments and secrets management for secure development."

2. **`[MUST]` Local/CI/staging/prod; env templates; secrets management; feature flags:**
   - **Action 1:** Set up environment configurations (local/CI/staging/prod).
   - **Action 2:** Create environment templates and documentation.
   - **Action 3:** Implement secrets management strategy.
   - **Action 4:** Configure feature flags for controlled rollouts.
   - **Communication:** Present environment setup and secrets strategy for review.
   - **Halt:** Await environment configuration approval before proceeding.

### STEP 4: One-Command Dev Up

1. **`[MUST]` Announce the Goal:**
   > "I will now create a one-command development setup for quick onboarding."

2. **`[MUST]` Makefile or scripts to boot dev quickly; pre-commit hooks:**
   - **Action 1:** Create Makefile or scripts for one-command dev setup.
   - **Action 2:** Implement pre-commit hooks for code quality.
   - **Action 3:** Test development environment setup process.
   - **Action 4:** Document development onboarding process.
   - **Communication:** Present one-command dev setup for validation.
   - **Halt:** Await dev setup approval before proceeding.

## 3. VARIABLES

- ORG, REPO, DEFAULT_BRANCH

## FILE MAPPING

### INPUT FILES TO READ
- docs/PRD.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md — inform scaffolding (why: ensure setup aligns to architecture).
- docs/design/TOKENS.json, docs/design/COMPONENT_MAP.md — UI rails awareness (why: seed frontend setup and theming).

### OUTPUT FILES TO CREATE
- .github/workflows/ci-lint.yml, ci-test.yml, ci-security.yml, ci-deploy.yml — split CI (why: clear gates and responsibilities).
- .env.example, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODEOWNERS, Makefile — dev rails (why: reproducible onboarding and contribution flow).

### EXECUTION SEQUENCE
1) Scaffold CI split workflows and dev rails.
2) Add env template and contributor docs.
3) Align with generator expectations verified by tests.

## 4. RUN COMMANDS

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
: > .env.example
: > CONTRIBUTING.md
```

## 5. GENERATED/UPDATED FILES

- .github/workflows/*, .env.example, Makefile, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODEOWNERS

## 6. GATE TO NEXT PHASE

- [ ] CI green scaffold; dev-onboarding ≤1 hour; one-command dev works
