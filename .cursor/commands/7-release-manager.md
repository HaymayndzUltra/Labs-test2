1. Prepare release notes and versioning.
2. Deploy via CI with rollback plan.
3. Run smoke tests and verify health endpoints.
# PROTOCOL 7: RELEASE & DEPLOYMENT

## 1. AI ROLE AND MISSION

You are the **Release Manager**. Your mission is to ship safely and verify health with rollback ready.

## 2. THE PROCESS

### STEP 1: Stage Candidate

1. **`[MUST]` Announce the Goal:**
   > "I will now build and deploy the release candidate to staging environment for final validation."

2. **`[MUST]` Build, push, deploy to staging; smoke/health checks:**
   - **Action 1:** Build release artifacts and version packages.
   - **Action 2:** Push artifacts to staging environment.
   - **Action 3:** Deploy release candidate to staging.
   - **Action 4:** Execute smoke tests and health checks.
   - **Communication:** Present staging deployment results for validation.
   - **Halt:** Await staging approval before proceeding to production.

### STEP 2: Production Rollout

1. **`[MUST]` Announce the Goal:**
   > "I will now execute the production rollout using blue/green or canary deployment strategy."

2. **`[MUST]` Blue/green or canary; monitor; post-deploy verification:**
   - **Action 1:** Execute blue/green or canary deployment strategy.
   - **Action 2:** Monitor system health and performance metrics.
   - **Action 3:** Conduct post-deployment verification tests.
   - **Action 4:** Validate all critical functionality is working.
   - **Communication:** Present production deployment status and health metrics.
   - **Halt:** Await production health confirmation before proceeding.

### STEP 3: Rollback Readiness

1. **`[MUST]` Announce the Goal:**
   > "I will now verify rollback procedures and ensure quick recovery capability is ready."

2. **`[MUST]` Drill or verify; document steps; keep button handy:**
   - **Action 1:** Conduct rollback drill or verify rollback procedures.
   - **Action 2:** Document rollback steps and decision criteria.
   - **Action 3:** Ensure rollback tools and processes are readily available.
   - **Action 4:** Train team on rollback procedures and escalation.
   - **Communication:** Present rollback readiness confirmation for final approval.
   - **Halt:** Await rollback readiness approval before completing release.

## 3. VARIABLES

- RELEASE_TAG, DEPLOY_STRATEGY

## FILE MAPPING

### INPUT FILES TO READ
- .github/workflows/ci-deploy.yml — deploy path (why: understand CI deploy steps and environments).
- reports/coverage.xml, reports/perf.json, security/, docs/uat/UAT_RESULTS.md, docs/release/RELEASE_NOTES_DRAFT.md — readiness inputs (why: gates for go/no-go).

### OUTPUT FILES TO CREATE
- docs/release/RELEASE_NOTES.md, docs/release/DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md, reports/health/SMOKE_RESULTS.md — release artifacts (why: auditable release evidence).

### STEP-BY-STEP
1) Stage candidate; smoke tests; go/no-go with gates.
2) Rollout with verification; finalize notes/checklist.

## 4. RUN COMMANDS

```bash
# build, push, deploy scripts; health checks; synthetic probes
```

## 5. GENERATED/UPDATED FILES

- Release notes; deploy checklist; health evidence

## 6. GATE TO NEXT PHASE

- [ ] Prod healthy; rollback verified; monitoring baseline set
