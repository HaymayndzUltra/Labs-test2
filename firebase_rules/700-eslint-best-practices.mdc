- Use a consistent coding style by extending popular configurations (e.g., Airbnb).
- Enable TypeScript support with `@typescript-eslint` for better linting.
- Regularly run linting as part of your CI/CD pipeline.
- Customize rules to fit your team's coding standards.
- Use ESLint plugins to enforce best practices for imports and other patterns.
