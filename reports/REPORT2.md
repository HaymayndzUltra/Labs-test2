PHASE 1: Priority directories
Trigger commands: structure and patterns
Each trigger has YAML frontmatter with TAGS/TRIGGERS/SCOPE and a globs pointer into .cursor/dev-workflow/*.md, then a short protocol section.

Evidence:

---

Development workflow: structure and patterns
Protocol 0 bootstraps context and rules normalization.
1.  [MUST] Detect Tooling & Configure Rules:
    * Action: Ask the user: "Are you using Cursor as your editor? …
    * Action: First, dynamically locate the rules directories: find . -name "master-rules" …
    * Action: If the user responds "yes" … Create `.cursor/rules/` and move the found rule directories there
    * … Rename files to `.mdc` … Verify/Add Metadata …
Workflow overview defines 5 steps and embeds quality and retrospective checkpoints between parent tasks.
Step 0: Bootstrap Your Project … Apply instructions from dev-workflow/0-bootstrap-your-project.md
…
Run the Quality Control Audit … Apply instructions from dev-workflow/4-quality-control-protocol.md

PHASE 2: Comprehensive codebase analysis
Project structure and architecture
Top-level components include rules and workflow system, a project generator, template packs (frontend/backend/database), CI/gates, and multiple demo/generated outputs. Key directories:
.cursor/rules/* (master/common/project rules, triggers)
.cursor/dev-workflow/* (protocols, router, policy-dsl, CI checks)
project_generator/* (generator core/templates/tests)
template-packs/* (scaffolded stacks with manifests)
frameworks/*, docs/*, scripts/*, observability/*
Evidence:

A comprehensive, industry-aware project generator that creates production-ready applications with built-in compliance, CI/CD pipelines, and AI Governor Framework integration.

Core components and modules
Development workflow router with precedence and policy evaluation:
RULES_DIR = ROOT / '.cursor' / 'rules'
PRECEDENCE_FILE = RULES_DIR / 'master-rules' / '9-governance-precedence.mdc'
POLICY_DIR = ROOT / '.cursor' / 'dev-workflow' / 'policy-dsl'
Substring-based policy evaluation (risks false positives):
def evaluate_policies(policies, context_map):
    normalized_context = _normalize_context(context_map)
    matches = []
    for policy in policies:
        conditions = policy.get('conditions') or []
        conditions_lc = [str(c).lower() for c in conditions]
        if all(c in normalized_context for c in conditions_lc):
            matches.append(policy)
    matches.sort(key=lambda x: x.get('priority', 0), reverse=True)
    return matches
LRU-cached routing decisions persisted to .cursor/dev-workflow/routing_logs.
Observation:

The router expects master-rules/9-governance-precedence.mdc, but the master rules directory lists only 0–6, no 9, so precedence will be empty and tie-breaking degraded.
Configuration files and settings
Context cache config disables encryption (sensitive in healthcare contexts):
security:
  encryption:
    enabled: false  # Set to true for sensitive data
    algorithm: "AES-256"
Industry rule activation includes healthcare triggers and some typos:
industry_patterns:
  healthcare:
    primary_rules:
      - "common-rule-client-industry-patterns"
      - "healthcare-compliance"
      - "hipaa-patterns"
      - "patient-data-protection"
compliance_rules:
  - "hipaa-compliance"
  - "hitECH-compliance"
…
security_rules:
  - "encryption-at-rest"
  - "audit-logging"
  - "rbac-patterns"
Intelligent precedence config expects base order:
base_precedence:
  - "F8-security-and-compliance-overlay"
  - "8-auditor-validator-protocol"
  - "4-master-rule-code-modification-safety-protocol"
  - "3-master-rule-code-quality-checklist"

PHASE 3: Synthesis and recommendations
Priority technical improvements
P0: Fix routing precedence file and robust tie-breaking
Evidence: Router expects missing 9-governance-precedence.mdc (router.py L45–L47).
Action:
Create /.cursor/rules/master-rules/9-governance-precedence.mdc with a “Priority Order” list matching intelligent-precedence-config.yaml.
Add explicit fallback ordering and logging when precedence file is missing; example:
# Example improvement for tie-break fallback (router.py)
def load_precedence():
    ...
    if not PRECEDENCE_FILE.exists():
        _PREC_CACHE = ["F8-security-and-compliance-overlay",
                       "8-auditor-validator-protocol",
                       "4-master-rule-code-modification-safety-protocol",
                       "3-master-rule-code-quality-checklist",
                       "6-master-rule-complex-feature-context-preservation",
                       "2-master-rule-ai-collaboration-guidelines",
                       "5-master-rule-documentation-and-context-guidelines",
                       "7-dev-workflow-command-router",
                       "project-rules"]
        _PREC_MTIME = None
        return _PREC_CACHE
P0: Correct trigger-command protocol mappings (off-by-one)
Evidence: 05/06/07 mismatches in files cited above.
Action: Align description labels and globs so:
05 = Iterative Implementation
06 = QA & Hardening
07 = Release & Deployment
08 = Security & Compliance (or rename to match handover doc), 09 = Documentation, 10 = Monitoring
Example correction (frontmatter):
# Example for 05-iterative-implementation.mdc
description: "TAGS: [trigger,command,workflow] | TRIGGERS: phase-05,implement,delivery | SCOPE: project-rules | DESCRIPTION: Trigger to apply Iterative Implementation workflow instructions."
globs: .cursor/dev-workflow/5-iterative-implementation.md
P0: Enable encryption for context cache (healthcare/HIPAA)
Evidence: encryption disabled (context-cache-config.yaml L145–151).
Action: Set enabled: true, ensure key management; sanitize sensitive tokens.
security:
  encryption:
    enabled: true
    algorithm: "AES-256"
    key_rotation_interval: 86400
P1: Harden policy matching to reduce false positives
Evidence: substring matching in evaluate_policies (router.py L117–128).
Action: tokenize/context-map keys or use exact tag matching; example:
def evaluate_policies(policies, context_map):
    tokens = set(_normalize_context(context_map).split())
    def satisfies(policy):
        required = set(str(c).lower() for c in policy.get('conditions') or [])
        return required.issubset(tokens)
    matches = [p for p in policies if satisfies(p)]
    return sorted(matches, key=lambda x: x.get('priority', 0), reverse=True)
P1: Fix typos and taxonomy in industry activation

Evidence: "hitECH-compliance" typo (industry-rule-activation.yaml L12–15).
Action: Correct to "HITECH-compliance", normalize rule identifiers, and ensure they exist.
P1: Add missing monitoring of precedence/audit consistency

Evidence: gates reference manifests/digests but not precedence checks.
Action: Add CI check to verify precedence file exists and matches intelligent-precedence-config.yaml base order.
P2: Normalize rule file extensions and metadata

Evidence: .cursor/rules/sample1.md alongside .mdc.
Action: Convert .md to .mdc, ensure YAML frontmatter with standardized description and alwaysApply.
P2: Improve dev-workflow docs alignment wording

Evidence: Protocol labels vs trigger labels inconsistencies (05–10).
Action: Standardize naming across trigger files, dev-workflow docs, and README steps.
P2: Strengthen structured logging and correlation

Evidence: Router logs to JSON without correlation config exposure.
Action: Add configurable correlation ID propagation and rotate/mask any sensitive fields.
P3: Expand unit tests around router decisions

Action: Add tests to cover precedence tie-breakers, missing precedence file, and policy condition edge cases.
Process optimizations
Quality gate coverage: Ensure the CI checks referenced in gates_config.yaml exist in frameworks/*; add a “fail if missing artifacts” preflight.
Rule hygiene automation: Use .cursor/dev-workflow/ci/normalize_project_rules.py in a CI job to validate rule metadata on PRs.
Phase gates clarity: Add a short “Phase mapping table” in .cursor/dev-workflow/README.md to avoid off-by-one errors.
Security posture by industry: When industry=healthcare, automatically toggle context-cache-config.yaml encryption and set tighter TTLs (already supported by industry_adjustments).
Strategic recommendations
Policy engine evolution: Move from substring matching to declarative JSON-schema or CEL-based policy conditions to reduce ambiguity and increase testability.
Governance single source: Add 9-governance-precedence.mdc with a clearly versioned “Priority Order” section; wire a CI check that diffs it against intelligent-precedence-config.yaml.
Compliance overlays: Implement an “overlay” rule bundle per industry (HIPAA/SOX/GDPR/PCI) that is activated by the router with signed evidence artifacts for audits.
Priority implementation roadmap
Week 1 (Critical):

Create 9-governance-precedence.mdc; add CI check parity with intelligent precedence.
Fix trigger-command mappings (05–07), align names across docs.
Enable cache encryption for healthcare; rotate keys and add sanitization tests.
Week 2 (Stability):

Refactor router policy matcher to token/set logic; add unit tests for tie-breakers and no-precedence case.
Normalize .md to .mdc and frontmatter metadata; run rule hygiene in CI.
Week 3 (Observability and Compliance):

Add structured correlation IDs to routing logs; redact sensitive context fields.
Implement CI “artifact presence” checks for all references in gates_config.yaml.
Week 4 (Evolution):

Prototype JSON-schema/CEL policy definitions and an evaluator; backfill tests.
Draft “overlay bundle” rules for HIPAA with auditable outputs.
Innovation opportunities
Adaptive precedence: Use telemetry to learn effective precedence in practice and suggest governance adjustments with evidence.
Context-aware cache: Dynamically reduce TTLs when PHI-related rules are active; prewarm context on common dev flows.
Rule analytics: Track rule activation frequency and conflicts, suggesting consolidation or clarifications.
Code examples (illustrative)
Enable encryption and stricter TTL for healthcare (context-cache-config):
security:
  encryption:
    enabled: true
ttl:
  industry_adjustments:
    healthcare: 3600
Correct trigger mapping frontmatter (example for 06):
description: "… phase-06,qa,hardening …"
globs: .cursor/dev-workflow/6-qa-and-hardening.md
Verification checklist (what I validated)
Read trigger-command implementations (01–10) and noted mapping mismatches.
Read dev-workflow protocols (0–9), CI gates, router, configs.
Cross-referenced master rules (1,2) and project contents.
Confirmed template manifests for FastAPI and Next.js.
Identified missing precedence file referenced by router.
Short summary

Trigger workflow is well-structured but has mapping inconsistencies (05–07). Router expects a missing governance precedence file, degrading tie-break behavior. Cache encryption is disabled despite healthcare context. Policy matching is substring-based and may cause false positives. CI gates block on fail but need stronger artifact presence checks. I recommend fixing precedence, trigger mappings, enabling encryption, hardening policy evaluation, normalizing rules metadata, and adding tests and CI validations, in the priority order above.
