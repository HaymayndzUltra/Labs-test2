# File Organization Rules

## 1. Multi-Language File Organization
```
"Create a rule that organizes all source files by language: Python files in src/python/, JavaScript files in src/js/, CSS files in src/styles/, and HTML files in src/templates/"
```

## 2. Test File Organization
```
"Create a rule that puts all test files in a tests/ directory with subdirectories matching the src/ structure, and test files must end with _test.py"
```

## 3. Configuration File Management
```
"Create a rule that keeps all config files (.json, .yaml, .env) in a config/ directory, except package.json which stays in root"
```

## 4. AI Project Structure
```
"Create a rule that all AI projects must start with: project structure setup (src/, data/, models/, notebooks/, tests/), environment configuration (requirements.txt, Dockerfile, .env), version control setup (Git with .gitignore), documentation template (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md), and initial project planning with clear objectives, success metrics, and timeline"
```

## 5. Modular Architecture
```
"Create a rule that all AI projects must follow modular architecture: data layer (data ingestion, preprocessing, validation), model layer (training, evaluation, inference), service layer (APIs, endpoints), and infrastructure layer (deployment, monitoring), with clear separation of concerns and dependency management"
```

## 6. Full-Stack Development Structure
```
"Create a comprehensive rule that covers: frontend files in src/frontend/, backend files in src/backend/, shared utilities in src/shared/, all with proper TypeScript types, ESLint config, and automated testing"
```

## 7. Microservices Architecture
```
"Create a rule that each microservice must have its own directory, Dockerfile, API documentation, and follow service discovery patterns"
```

## 8. Data Pipeline Structure
```
"Create a rule that all data processing pipelines must have input validation, error handling, retry logic, and data quality checks"
```
