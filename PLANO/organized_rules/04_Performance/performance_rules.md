# Performance Rules

## 1. Database Query Optimization
```
"Create a rule that all database queries must be optimized, use indexes, avoid N+1 queries, and include query performance monitoring"
```

## 2. Caching Strategy
```
"Create a rule that all expensive operations must be cached with appropriate TTL, and cache keys must follow naming convention: module:function:params"
```

## 3. Memory Management
```
"Create a rule that all large data processing must use generators, streaming, or pagination, and memory usage must be monitored"
```

## 4. High Availability
```
"Create a rule that all critical services must have 99.9% uptime, include load balancing, have auto-scaling policies, and support blue-green deployments with zero downtime"
```

## 5. Database Performance
```
"Create a rule that all database queries must be optimized, include connection pooling, have read replicas, and include query performance monitoring with slow query logging"
```

## 6. Caching Strategy with Redis
```
"Create a rule that all expensive operations must be cached with Redis, include cache invalidation strategies, have cache warming, and include cache hit ratio monitoring"
```

## 7. AI Performance Optimization
```
"Create a rule that all AI projects must optimize performance: code optimization (profiling, optimization), data optimization (caching, compression), model optimization (quantization, pruning), infrastructure optimization (auto-scaling, load balancing), and monitoring (performance metrics, bottlenecks)"
```

## 8. Scalability Planning
```
"Create a rule that all AI projects must plan for scalability: horizontal scaling (load balancing, distributed computing), vertical scaling (resource allocation, optimization), data scaling (partitioning, sharding), model scaling (distributed training, inference), and cost optimization (resource utilization, cost monitoring)"
```

## 9. Resource Management
```
"Create a rule that all AI projects must manage resources efficiently: resource allocation (CPU, memory, GPU), cost monitoring (cloud costs, resource usage), resource optimization (right-sizing, auto-scaling), and resource planning (capacity planning, growth projections)"
```

## 10. Frontend Performance
```
"Create a rule that all frontend code must be code-split, include lazy loading, have proper memoization, and support Progressive Web App features with service workers"
```

## 11. Model Optimization
```
"Create a rule that all AI projects must include model optimization: performance optimization (inference speed, memory usage), model compression (quantization, pruning, distillation), hardware optimization (GPU, CPU, edge devices), and deployment optimization (containerization, API optimization)"
```
