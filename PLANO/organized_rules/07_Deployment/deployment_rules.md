# Deployment Rules

## 1. Environment Configuration
```
"Create a rule that all environment-specific configs must be in .env files, never hardcoded, and include validation for required variables"
```

## 2. Build and Deployment
```
"Create a rule that all deployments must go through staging environment, include health checks, and have rollback procedures"
```

## 3. Monitoring and Logging
```
"Create a rule that all applications must have structured logging, health check endpoints, and monitoring dashboards"
```

## 4. AI Model Deployment
```
"Create a rule that all AI projects must have automated deployment: containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), API development (REST, GraphQL), load balancing and scaling, health checks and monitoring, rollback capabilities, and A/B testing infrastructure"
```

## 5. Model Monitoring
```
"Create a rule that all AI projects must implement comprehensive monitoring: model performance monitoring (accuracy, latency, throughput), data drift detection (statistical tests, distribution changes), model drift detection (performance degradation), infrastructure monitoring (CPU, memory, disk), and alerting systems (email, Slack, PagerDuty)"
```

## 6. Model Lifecycle Management
```
"Create a rule that all AI projects must have model lifecycle management: model versioning (semantic versioning, Git tags), model registry (MLflow, DVC), model promotion (development → staging → production), model retirement (deprecation, archiving), and model governance (approval workflows, compliance checks)"
```

## 7. Infrastructure as Code
```
"Create a rule that all infrastructure must be defined as code using Terraform, include proper state management, have automated testing with Terratest, support multiple environments, and include disaster recovery procedures"
```

## 8. CI/CD Pipeline
```
"Create a rule that all CI/CD pipelines must include automated testing, security scanning, performance testing, deployment to staging environment, approval gates, and automated rollback capabilities"
```

## 9. GitOps Workflow
```
"Create a rule that all deployments must use GitOps workflow, include automated testing, have proper rollback procedures, support blue-green deployments, and include comprehensive monitoring"
```

## 10. Container Security
```
"Create a rule that all Docker images must be scanned for vulnerabilities, use distroless base images, have proper user permissions, and be signed with Cosign for supply chain security"
```

## 11. Cloud Deployment
```
"Create a rule that all cloud architectures must follow Well-Architected Framework, include proper cost optimization, have disaster recovery plans, support multi-region deployment, and include proper security controls"
```

## 12. MLOps Deployment
```
"Create a rule that all MLOps teams must have: Platform Engineers (Kubernetes, Docker), ML Engineers (model serving, A/B testing), Data Engineers (pipeline orchestration), and DevOps Engineers (CI/CD, monitoring), with expertise in Kubeflow, MLflow, and cloud platforms"
```
