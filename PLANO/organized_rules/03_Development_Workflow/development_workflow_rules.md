# Development Workflow Rules

## 1. Git Commit Standards
```
"Create a rule that all commits must follow conventional commit format: type(scope): description, and include type validation (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)"
```

## 2. Code Review Requirements
```
"Create a rule that all pull requests must have at least 2 reviewers, pass all tests, and include a checklist of security, performance, and maintainability checks"
```

## 3. Dependency Management
```
"Create a rule that all new dependencies must be justified in PR description, pinned to specific versions, and added to requirements.txt with version constraints"
```

## 4. AI Team Collaboration
```
"Create a rule that all AI projects must foster collaboration: code reviews (pull requests, feedback), knowledge sharing (documentation, tech talks), pair programming (collaborative development), and regular meetings (standups, retrospectives, planning)"
```

## 5. AI Knowledge Management
```
"Create a rule that all AI projects must maintain knowledge: documentation (technical docs, user guides), code comments (inline documentation, docstrings), version control (Git history, commit messages), and knowledge sharing (wikis, documentation sites)"
```

## 6. AI Project Management
```
"Create a rule that all AI projects must follow project management: agile methodology (sprints, user stories), task tracking (Jira, Trello, GitHub Issues), progress monitoring (dashboards, reports), and stakeholder communication (updates, demos, reviews)"
```

## 7. Cross-Team Collaboration
```
"Create a rule that all AI teams must have regular cross-team meetings, shared documentation, common tools and platforms, knowledge sharing sessions, and joint project planning, with emphasis on breaking down silos and fostering collaboration"
```

## 8. AI Team Knowledge Management
```
"Create a rule that all AI teams must maintain comprehensive documentation, share research findings, conduct regular tech talks, maintain code repositories, and have mentorship programs, with focus on knowledge preservation and team growth"
```

## 9. AI Team Performance
```
"Create a rule that all AI teams must have clear performance metrics, regular reviews, skill development plans, career progression paths, and recognition programs, with emphasis on team productivity and individual growth"
```

## 10. Technical Lead Management
```
"Create a rule that all technical decisions must be documented, include team consensus, have proper code review process, support knowledge sharing, and include regular technical debt assessment"
```

## 11. Project Planning
```
"Create a rule that all projects must include proper estimation, have risk assessment, include milestone planning, support agile methodology, and include regular retrospectives"
```
