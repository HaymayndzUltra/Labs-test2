## Gap Detection System

### Rule Coverage Analysis
- **Scan project structure** for uncovered areas

5. **Suggest** rule creation
6. **Track** gap resolution

## Dependency Mapping System

### Rule Relationship Types
- **Prerequisite Rules**: Rules that must exist before others

- **Reorganize Rules**: Restructure rule hierarchy
- **Merge Rules**: Combine related rules

## Autonomy Modes

### Suggest-Only Mode
- **Behavior**: Only suggest rule changes, never apply automatically
- **Use Case**: High-risk environments, compliance-critical projects
- **Guardrails**: All suggestions require manual approval

### Auto-Chain Mode
- **Behavior**: Automatically apply rule chains and dependencies
- **Use Case**: Well-established projects with trusted rule sets
- **Guardrails**: Pre-validate all rule applications
- **Evaluation**: Monitor auto-application success rates

### Guarded-Apply Mode
- **Behavior**: Apply rules with safety checks and rollback capability
- **Use Case**: Balanced autonomy with safety controls
- **Guardrails**: Multiple validation layers and rollback options
- **Evaluation**: Track success rates and rollback frequency

### Mode Selection Criteria
- **Project Maturity**: New projects use suggest-only, mature projects use auto-chain
- **Risk Tolerance**: High-risk projects use guarded-apply
- **Team Experience**: Experienced teams can use auto-chain
- **Compliance Requirements**: Regulated environments use suggest-only

## Guardrails System
