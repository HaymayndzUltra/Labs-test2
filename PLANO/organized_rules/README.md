## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Browse by Category**: Navigate to the specific folder for your area of interest
2. **Copy Commands**: Use the rule commands directly in your AI assistant
3. **Customize**: Modify the commands to fit your specific project needs
4. **Combine**: Mix and match rules from different categories for comprehensive coverage

## üìù Rule Command Format

All rules follow this format:
```
"Create a rule that [specific requirement] with [additional conditions] and [enforcement level] for [file types]"
```

## üéØ Quick Start Examples

### For File Organization:
```
"Create a rule that organizes all source files by language: Python files in src/python/, JavaScript files in src/js/, CSS files in src/styles/, and HTML files in src/templates/"
```

### For AI Development:
```
"Create a rule that all AI projects must follow modular architecture: data layer (data ingestion, preprocessing, validation), model layer (training, evaluation, inference), service layer (APIs, endpoints), and infrastructure layer (deployment, monitoring)"
```

### For Team Management:
```
"Create a rule that all AI teams must have regular cross-team meetings, shared documentation, common tools and platforms, knowledge sharing sessions, and joint project planning"
```

## üí° Tips for Effective Rule Creation

1. **Be Specific**: Include exact technologies, tools, and patterns
2. **Think Holistically**: Consider the entire system, not just individual components
3. **Include Metrics**: Specify what success looks like
4. **Consider Edge Cases**: What happens when things go wrong?
5. **Plan for Scale**: How will this work with 10x more data/users?

## üîÑ Rule Evolution

- Rules should be reviewed monthly
- Updated based on team feedback
- Deprecated rules should be archived
- New rules should be added as needs evolve
