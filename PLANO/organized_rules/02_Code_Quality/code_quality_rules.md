# Code Quality Rules

## 1. Documentation Requirements
```
"Create a rule that requires all Python functions to have docstrings with Args, Returns, and Raises sections, and all classes to have class-level docstrings"
```

## 2. Error Handling Standards
```
"Create a rule that all API endpoints must have try-catch blocks, log errors with context, and return consistent error response format with error codes"
```

## 3. Security Standards
```
"Create a rule that all user inputs must be validated and sanitized, passwords must be hashed, and sensitive data must not be logged"
```

## 4. AI Security Measures
```
"Create a rule that all AI projects must implement security measures: data encryption (at rest, in transit), access controls (authentication, authorization), model security (adversarial robustness, model poisoning), API security (rate limiting, input validation), and security monitoring (intrusion detection, anomaly detection)"
```

## 5. AI Compliance
```
"Create a rule that all AI projects must ensure compliance: data privacy (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA), model transparency (explainability, interpretability), audit trails (data access, model changes), documentation (compliance reports, risk assessments), and regular compliance reviews (quarterly assessments, updates)"
```

## 6. AI Ethics
```
"Create a rule that all AI projects must follow ethical guidelines: bias detection and mitigation, fairness assessment, transparency and explainability, human oversight, and ethical review processes with stakeholder involvement"
```

## 7. Zero Trust Security
```
"Create a rule that all systems must follow zero-trust security model, include proper authentication and authorization, have network segmentation, support encryption everywhere, and include security monitoring"
```

## 8. Vulnerability Management
```
"Create a rule that all systems must have automated vulnerability scanning, include dependency checking, have security testing in CI/CD, support penetration testing, and include security incident response"
```

## 9. GDPR Compliance
```
"Create a rule that all personal data must be encrypted at rest and in transit, include data retention policies, have audit logging, and support data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure)"
```

## 10. Security Scanning
```
"Create a rule that all code must be scanned with SonarQube, include SAST/DAST testing, have dependency vulnerability scanning, and include security headers validation"
```
